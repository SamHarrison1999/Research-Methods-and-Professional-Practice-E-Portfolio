            <h5 id="CollaborativeDiscussionSummaryPost">Collaborative Discussion Summary Post</h5>
            <p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></p>
            <p>In the case study Abi&rsquo;s ethical dilemma centres on the analysis of the nutritional value of a new
              cereal called Whizzz. Their analysis suggests that Whizz is less nutritious than claimed and may even be
              harmful. However, Abi is under pressure to use statistical techniques that could present the product in a
              more favourable light. This scenario raises concerns about the ethical, legal, professional and social&nbsp;
              responsibilities in research. Abi must navigate these challenges to ensure their work aligns with the
              highest standards of integrity and accountability.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Ethical Integrity</u></strong></p>
            <p>Maintaining integrity is integral to any research. Researchers are responsible for the honesty,
              transparency and objectivity of their work. The British Psychological Society&rsquo;s Code of Human
              Research Ethics states researchers must ensure their work does not mislead or harm others (British
              Psychological Society, 2014). Manipulating or selectively presenting data risks distorting the truth,
              misleading stakeholders and undermining public trust. Abi has a moral obligation to present a balanced
              analysis of their findings. Ethical research practices demand transparency and objectivity to maintain
              credibility and integrity to ensure ethical decision-making (British Psychological Society, 2014).</p>
            <p><strong><u>Legal and Professional Accountability </u></strong></p>
            <p>By making misleading claims about Whizzz, Abi could potentially by violating consumer protection laws
              such
              as the UK's Unfair Trading Regulations (Unfair Trading Regulations, 2008) which strictly prohibit
              deceptive advertising practices. If the manufacturer uses Abi&rsquo;s finding selectively Abi would be
              complicit in any harm caused to the consumers. Additionally, professional codes of conduct such as the ACM
              Code of Ethics (ACM, 2018) and the BCS Code of Conduct (BCS, 2022) outline the importance of preventing
              harm, ensuring accuracy and the greater good. Abi must therefore ensure their analyses are used ethically
              and responsibly safeguarding against misuse.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Social Implications</u></strong></p>
            <p>Misrepresenting the nutritional value of Whizzz could mislead customers and encourage them into making
              harmful dietary choices. In addition to causing harm, such actions could destroy trust in scientific
              research as biased or misleading findings dimmish the credibility of researchers and institutions. It is a
              researcher&rsquo;s responsibility to advocate for the ethical use of their findings to protect public
              welfare and trust in scientific research. This requires the researcher to take a proactive approach to
              ensure ethical standards are met.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Responses from my peers</u></strong></p>
            <p>The responses from Tala and Bahar to my initial post provided useful insights into the possible ways Abi
              could solve the ethical dilemma present in the case study. Both Tala and Bahar emphasised the importance
              of including disclaimers and contractual agreements to prevent the misuse of Abi&rsquo;s findings. Using
              disclaimers to clarify the scope and limitations of the research in conjunction with contractual
              agreements to prevent the misuse of the data and establish legal accountability would help to promote
              transparency, trust, and ethical accountability in Abi&rsquo;s work.</p>
            <p>Bahar also suggested that Abi considers publishing their findings in a peer reviewed journal to ensure
              transparency and accountability as publishing in a peer reviewed journal would allow for critical scrutiny
              by other researchers. Furthermore, publishing in an open-access format aligns with the European
              Commission's Horizon Open Access Policy (European Commission, 2020). Whilst this would promote ethical
              knowledge dissemination, Abi must remain vigilant about how their finding may be misused by others.</p>
            <p>Both responses acknowledged the ethical, legal, and social challenges discussed in the initial post and
              emphasised the importance of proactive solutions. By combining these strategies, Abi can address their
              responsibilities effectively.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Recommendations</u></strong></p>
            <p>Abi should follow a multiple step approach to address their ethical dilemma. First, Abi should present
              both the positive and negative findings from their analysis to ensure honesty, credibility and objectivity
              to minimise the risk of misuse. Then Abi should communicate with the manufacturer regarding the ethical
              and legal risks associated with selective reporting. Then Abi should publish their finding in a peer
              reviewed journal to ensure greater transparency and accountability. Lastly, Abi should include disclaimers
              and contract agreements in their research to safeguard against misuse and ensure ethical
              accountability.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
            <p>Abi&rsquo;s situation highlights the interconnectedness of ethical responsibility, legal accountability
              and societal impact in research. By following my recommendations, Abi can uphold professional integrity
              and
              protect public trust. Abi&rsquo;s commitment to ethical principles will help to strengthen their
              reputation as a researcher and contribute to the credibility of scientific research.</p>

            <h5>How the artefact relates to the module objectives</h5>
            <p>The Collaborative Discussion Summary Post in Unit 9 directly supports several module objectives,
              particularly in the areas of academic investigation, critical evaluation of research methodologies, and
              professional and ethical considerations within computing research.</p>
            <p>One of the primary module objectives that this artefact aligns with is the ability to evaluate critically
              existing literature, research design, and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis
              processes. The summary post serves as a synthesis of discussions that took place during the collaborative
              learning activity, requiring students to consolidate various viewpoints, research findings, and analytical
              insights from their peers. This process helps in deepening understanding of different research
              methodologies, as students must not only engage with diverse academic perspectives but also critically
              assess the strengths and limitations of different approaches.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the Collaborative Discussion Summary Post is relevant to the objective of appraising the
              principles of academic investigation and applying them to a research topic in computing. By summarizing
              key points from peer discussions, students must demonstrate their ability to integrate theoretical
              knowledge with practical applications. This involves interpreting peer insights, addressing potential
              research gaps, and formulating well-supported conclusions, all of which are crucial skills in conducting
              rigorous academic research in computing.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, this artefact contributes to appraising the professional, legal, social, cultural, and
              ethical issues that affect computing professionals. The collaborative discussions often include debates on
              ethical dilemmas, legal considerations, and the broader social implications of computing research. By
              summarizing these discussions, students reinforce their ability to analyse and articulate the ethical and
              legal responsibilities of researchers, particularly when dealing with sensitive topics such as data
              privacy, AI ethics, and responsible computing practices.</p>
            <p>The summary post also supports the objective of producing and critically evaluating the research proposal
              for the chosen topic. Effective research proposals require a well-rounded understanding of previous
              literature, methodological considerations, and potential ethical challenges. By reflecting on discussions
              and feedback from peers, students refine their approach to research design and data analysis, ensuring
              that their proposals are robust, ethically sound, and methodologically rigorous.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the Collaborative Discussion Summary Post serves as a valuable artefact in meeting the
              module objectives by fostering critical engagement with research methodologies, ethical considerations,
              and academic discourse. It enables students to consolidate knowledge, refine their analytical skills, and
              apply their learning in a structured, reflective manner, ultimately preparing them for advanced research
              and professional practice in computing.</p>
            <h5>Charts Worksheet</h5>
            <h5>How the artefacts relate to the module objectives</h5>
            <p>The Charts Worksheet activity in Unit 9 aligns with multiple module objectives, particularly those
              related to data analysis, research methodology, and the effective presentation of research findings.</p>
            <p>One key module objective supported by this artefact is the ability to evaluate critically existing
              literature, research design, and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes. The
              Charts Worksheet activity requires students to apply statistical and graphical techniques to data,
              reinforcing their ability to analyse, interpret, and present research findings effectively. Understanding
              how to construct and interpret charts is essential in quantitative research, as the visual representation
              of data plays a significant role in communicating patterns, trends, and relationships in research.</p>
            <p>Additionally, this activity supports the appraisal of the principles of academic investigation and their
              application to research topics in computing. In computing-related research, particularly in fields such as
              data science, cybersecurity, and AI, the ability to use charts and visualisations to support data-driven
              conclusions is crucial. Through this worksheet, students gain hands-on experience in choosing appropriate
              visualisation methods, ensuring that data presentation aligns with research objectives and conveys
              meaningful insights.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the Charts Worksheet activity contributes to the objective of appraising the professional,
              legal, social, cultural, and ethical issues that affect computing professionals. The ability to present
              data transparently and accurately is essential in ethical research practice, as misrepresentation of data&mdash;whether
              intentional or unintentional&mdash;can lead to misleading conclusions. This activity helps students
              understand the importance of clear, ethical, and unbiased data presentation, which is particularly
              relevant in fields where data-driven decisions have significant societal implications.</p>
            <p>This activity also plays a role in helping students produce and critically evaluate the research proposal
              for their chosen topic. A well-structured research proposal includes a clear data analysis plan, and
              charts often serve as preliminary exploratory tools that guide hypothesis formulation and data
              interpretation. By engaging in this worksheet, students enhance their ability to integrate visual data
              representation into their research methodology, ensuring that their proposals are well-supported by
              appropriate data analysis techniques.</p>
            <p>In summary, the Charts Worksheet activity directly supports the module objectives by equipping students
              with essential data visualisation skills, fostering critical thinking in research design, and emphasising
              the importance of ethical and transparent data communication. This artefact plays a crucial role in
              preparing students for computing research and professional practice, where the ability to interpret and
              present data effectively is fundamental.</p>

          <!-- Reflection Section -->
          <h5 id="reflection">Reflection</h5>
          <p><strong><u>Description</u></strong></p>
          <p>This unit was the ninth unit of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module. This unit focused on
            Validity and Generalisability in research. The goals of this unit were to define and differentiate the
            concepts of validity, generalisability, and reliability, and explain their role in designing robust research
            methods, to analyse the differences between qualitative and quantitative data, to understand the processes
            of data cleansing and validation in ensuring accurate and reliable results and to develop skills to present
            research findings effectively.</p>
          <p>There was no required reading for this unit, allowing me to dedicate additional time to my upcoming
            assignment. The formative activities included completing the summary post for the collaborative discussion,
            the charts' worksheet, and the Power BI tutorial. There was also a lecture case on Validity and
            Generalisability.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Feelings</u></strong></p>
          <p>I initially felt relieved that there were no mandatory readings, as this provided extra time to focus on my
            assignment. However, my experience with the charts' worksheet was frustrating, as it contained multiple
            errors that led to confusion and difficulty in completing the task correctly. Additionally, the Power BI
            tutorial required publishing the document, but I was unable to do so using my university email, as access to
            Microsoft Fabric was blocked. This created an additional challenge that I had not expected, leaving me
            feeling frustrated and unprepared for this aspect of data visualisation.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Evaluation</u></strong></p>
          <p>The unit effectively introduced the key concepts of validity and generalisability, which are crucial for
            ensuring the credibility of research. However, the errors in the charts' worksheet significantly impacted my
            ability to complete the activity efficiently. The lack of clear instructions regarding the Power BI
            publishing requirement also added unnecessary stress. While I appreciated the flexibility to focus on my
            assignment, the technical issues hindered my ability to fully engage with the unit&rsquo;s content.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Analysis</u></strong></p>
          <p>The issues I faced in this unit highlight the importance of ensuring that learning materials are accurate
            and that technical requirements are properly communicated to students. The errors in the charts' worksheet
            suggest a need for better quality control in the preparation of course materials. Additionally, the Power BI
            issue demonstrates how institutional restrictions can sometimes conflict with learning activities, creating
            barriers to completing coursework. If clearer guidance had been provided or alternative solutions offered,
            my experience with this unit would have been significantly improved.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
          <p>Overall, while the unit provided valuable insights into research validity and generalisability, technical
            and logistical challenges prevented me from fully engaging with all aspects of the learning material. If the
            charts' worksheet had been error-free and the Power BI tutorial had clear alternative instructions, my
            experience would have been much more positive. Despite these setbacks, I was still able to complete the
            summary post and gain a better understanding of the importance of ensuring research findings are reliable
            and applicable.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Action plan</u></strong></p>
          <p>Moving forward, I will take proactive steps to address similar challenges. First, I will check university
            resources or forums early in the unit to identify potential technical issues that other students may have
            encountered. If errors are present in the learning materials, I will raise them with the instructor
            immediately rather than attempting to work around them. Additionally, for software-based tasks, I will
            explore alternative tools or seek guidance from IT support to avoid delays (Salmon, 2020). Finally, I will
            allocate additional time for technical components of coursework to ensure that unexpected barriers, such as
            software restrictions, do not impact my ability to complete tasks efficiently.</p>

          <p>The Unit 9 Reflection also contributes to the objective of appraising professional, legal, social,
            cultural, and ethical issues that affect computing professionals. As students reflect on validity and
            reliability, they must consider the ethical implications of misrepresented or biased data, the importance of
            transparency in research, and the responsibility of computing professionals to uphold research integrity.
            This reinforces ethical awareness and prepares students to navigate real-world research challenges with
            professional responsibility.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, this reflection ties into the objective of producing and evaluating critically the resulting
            research proposal for the chosen topic. By reflecting on their learning, students can identify gaps in their
            research approach, consider alternative methodologies, and refine their proposals based on insights gained
            from Unit 9. Reflection allows for continuous improvement, ensuring that students can create robust,
            well-structured research proposals that effectively address their chosen research questions.</p>
          <p>Beyond academic skills, the Unit 9 Reflection also fosters critical thinking, self-awareness, and
            professional development&mdash;all of which are essential for a career in computing and research. By
            actively engaging in reflective practice, students develop the ability to adapt their research strategies,
            apply feedback constructively, and make informed decisions in future research endeavours.</p>
          <p>In summary, the Unit 9 Reflection directly supports the module objectives by reinforcing research
            integrity, methodological awareness, critical evaluation of academic literature, and ethical considerations
            in computing research. It provides an opportunity for self-directed learning and continuous improvement,
