          </ul>

          <!-- Artefacts Section -->
          <h4>Artefacts</h4>

          <div class="card mb-3">
            <p>For this unit, there weren't any artefacts. Instead, we were tasked with working on the e-portfolio
              assignment making sure any formative activities weren't outstanding.</p>
            <p>There was a formative activity to work begin working on the hypothesis testing and descriptive statistics
              exercises due in unit 7 that can be found below.</p>
            <h4>Summary Measures Worksheet</h4>
            <h5>How the artefacts relate to the module objectives</h5>
            <p>The Summary Measures Worksheet in Unit 6 of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module is
              directly aligned with the module objectives by providing hands-on experience with descriptive statistics
              and data analysis techniques, which are essential for conducting academic research in computing.</p>
            <p>One of the core module objectives is to appraise the principles of academic investigation and apply them
              to a research topic in the applicable computing field. The worksheet requires students to engage with
              summary statistics, such as measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion
              (standard deviation, variance, interquartile range). These statistical tools are fundamental in analysing
              datasets, identifying patterns, and making data-driven decisions&mdash;skills that are crucial for
              research in computing disciplines such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and software
              engineering.</p>
            <p>The worksheet also supports the objective of evaluating critically existing literature, research design,
              and methodology, including data analysis processes. Through the completion of statistical calculations and
              data interpretations, students gain the ability to assess the reliability and significance of research
              findings. Understanding summary measures helps in interpreting empirical studies, designing experiments,
              and validating research hypotheses. This knowledge is vital for ensuring that data analysis is both
              accurate and methodologically sound in computing research.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the Summary Measures Worksheet aligns with the module objective of appraising the
              professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical issues that affect computing professionals. In
              computing research, quantitative data analysis plays a key role in decision-making, whether it is for
              evaluating cybersecurity risks, assessing software performance, or understanding user behaviour in digital
              systems. Ethical considerations, such as bias in data collection, manipulation of statistics, and
              misinterpretation of results, must be accounted for when working with numerical datasets. By working
              through the worksheet, students develop an awareness of these ethical concerns and learn how to apply
              statistical techniques responsibly.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the worksheet contributes to the objective of producing and evaluating critically the
              resulting research proposal for the chosen topic. Research proposals often involve justifying data
              collection methods and defining the statistical techniques that will be used for analysis. The ability to
              calculate and interpret summary measures allows students to justify their chosen methodology and ensure
              that their data analysis approach aligns with the research objectives. This competency is crucial for
              constructing well-founded research proposals that meet academic and professional standards.</p>
            <p>The Summary Measures Worksheet is a practical exercise that reinforces the application of descriptive
              statistics in research. By engaging with statistical methods, students enhance their ability to analyse
              data, interpret results, and apply quantitative reasoning to computing-related problems. This activity
              strengthens their research skills, critical evaluation abilities, and ethical awareness in data analysis,
              ensuring alignment with the broader module objectives.</p>

            <h4>Hypothesis Testing Worksheet</h4>
            <h5>How the artefacts relate to the module objectives</h5>
            <p>The Hypothesis Testing Worksheet in Unit 6 of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module plays
              a crucial role in aligning with the module&rsquo;s objectives by reinforcing statistical inference
              principles, data-driven decision-making, and the critical evaluation of research findings in computing.
              Hypothesis testing is a fundamental aspect of research methodology, particularly in computing disciplines
              where empirical validation is necessary for software performance, machine learning models, and
              cybersecurity risk assessment.</p>
            <p>One of the core module objectives is to appraise the principles of academic investigation and apply them
              to a research topic in the applicable computing field. The worksheet enables students to gain hands-on
              experience in applying various hypothesis testing methods, such as t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA,
              which are commonly used in computing research to assess performance metrics, compare system efficiencies,
              or evaluate user behaviour. By engaging with this exercise, students develop the ability to make informed
              decisions based on statistical evidence, ensuring that their research findings are not based on
              assumptions but rather on quantifiable and verifiable data.</p>
            <p>Another significant module objective is to evaluate critically existing literature, research design, and
              methodology, including data analysis processes. The Hypothesis Testing Worksheet supports this objective
              by providing students with practical exposure to analysing research data, interpreting statistical
              results, and assessing the validity of conclusions drawn from empirical studies. Many research papers in
              computing fields rely on hypothesis testing to validate claims, and by working through this worksheet,
              students develop a deeper understanding of how statistical significance, confidence intervals, and
              p-values contribute to research rigour. This enhances their ability to critically assess published research
              and determine the reliability and applicability of findings to their own investigations.</p>
            <p>In addition to technical and methodological competencies, the worksheet also contributes to the appraisal
              of professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical issues that affect computing professionals. Ethical
              considerations in hypothesis testing are paramount, particularly in avoiding misrepresentation of results,
              p-hacking (selectively reporting only significant results), and improper data handling. These concerns are
              especially relevant in computing research, where statistical findings can influence decision-making in
              areas such as cybersecurity risk assessments, artificial intelligence, and public policy. By completing
              the worksheet, students develop an ethical approach to statistical analysis, ensuring that their research
              adheres to best practices in transparency, integrity, and responsible reporting of data.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the module objective of producing and critically evaluating a research proposal is also
              reinforced through the completion of the Hypothesis Testing Worksheet. When formulating research proposals
              in computing, students must not only define a clear research problem but also justify their choice of
              statistical methods, hypothesis testing approaches, and expected outcomes. By practicing hypothesis
              testing, students strengthen their ability to integrate statistical reasoning into their research design,
              ensuring that their proposed investigations are methodologically sound. Understanding how to apply
              hypothesis testing allows students to confidently design studies that produce valid and reliable results,
              which is a critical skill in both academic and professional research settings.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the Hypothesis Testing Worksheet serves as an integral learning tool within the Research
              Methods and Professional Practice module. It enhances students' ability to conduct rigorous data analysis,
              interpret statistical findings responsibly, and incorporate hypothesis testing into their academic
              research and professional practice. By completing this exercise, students refine their ability to appraise
              research methodologies, uphold ethical research standards, and apply statistical reasoning to real-world
              computing problems, ensuring alignment with the module&rsquo;s objectives and preparing them for future
              research endeavours in the field of computing.</p>

            <p>Example 7.2 asked us to use a spreadsheet file that wasn't provided, so I was unable to complete the
              exercise, so I provided a conceptual approach below.</p>
            <p><strong>1. Hypotheses</strong></p>
            <p>The goal is to test whether the population mean income for men exceeds that of women. This involves a
              one-tailed, two-sample t-test.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Null Hypothesis (𝐾<sub>0</sub>):</strong> The mean income for men (μ<sub>M</sub>) is less
                than or equal to the mean income for women (μ<sub>F</sub>)
              </li>
              <li><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (𝐾<sub>a</sub>):</strong> The mean income for men (μ<sub>M</sub>) is
                greater than the mean income for women (μ<sub>F</sub>)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>2. Test Statistic</strong></p>
            <p>The test statistic for a two-sample t-test is calculated as:</p>
            <pre>
            t = (X̄<sub>M</sub> - X̄<sub>F</sub>) / sqrt((s<sup>2</sup><sub>M</sub> / n<sub>M</sub>) + (s<sup>2</sup><sub>F</sub> / n<sub>F</sub>))
            </pre>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>X̄<sub>M</sub>, X̄<sub>F</sub>:</strong> Mean income of males and females, respectively.</li>
              <li><strong>s<sup>2</sup><sub>M</sub>, s<sup>2</sup><sub>F</sub>:</strong> Variances of male and female
                income samples.
              </li>
              <li><strong>n<sub>M</sub>, n<sub>F</sub>:</strong> Sample sizes of males and females, respectively.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>3. Assumptions for Validity</strong></p>
            <p>The validity of the test relies on these assumptions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Independence:</strong> Observations within and between the groups are independent.</li>
              <li><strong>Normality:</strong> The income data for both groups is approximately normally distributed.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Homogeneity of Variance:</strong> The variance of income is similar for men and women.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>4. Steps for Validation</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Independence:</strong> Check the design of the data collection to ensure no dependency exists
                between observations.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Normality:</strong> Use graphical methods or statistical tests to assess the distribution of
                income.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Homogeneity of Variance:</strong> Use Levene's test or Bartlett's test to verify whether
                variances are equal. If there are not, use a t-test assuming unequal variances.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>5. Interpretation</strong></p>
            <p>If the calculated p-value is less than the significance level, reject the null hypothesis and conclude
              that the population mean income for men is significantly higher than that for women. Otherwise, fail
              to reject the null hypothesis.</p>

            <p><strong>6. Reporting Findings</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Report the test statistic (t) and p-value.</li>
              <li>Include confidence intervals for the difference in means.</li>
              <li>Discuss practical significance, if applicable.</li>
            </ul>

          <p><strong><u>Description</u></strong></p>
          <p>This unit was the sixth unit of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module. This unit of the
            module focused on quantitative methods. The goals of this unit were to understand and apply descriptive
            statistics in data analysis, to identify and classify different levels of measurement for variables and to
            learn how to calculate and interpret measures of location and spread in numerical data.</p>
          <p>During this unit we were required to read chapter 2 &amp; 3 in the book Basic Business Statistics: Concepts
            and Applications (Berenson et al., 2019) and had to prepare for next week's seminar by attempting the
            Seminar preparation activity in unit 7.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Feelings</u></strong></p>
          <p>The reading for this unit didn't match what it said on the learning platform and didn&rsquo;t seem relevant
            as the learning platform said that the reading this week will give you more information on designing a
            questionnaire however it instead focused on different ways of visualising and analysing data rather than
            designing a questionnaire and the context of the examples weren&rsquo;t relevant to computer science.</p>
          <p>The worksheets for the seminar preparation activity on Summary Measures and Hypothesis Testing were both
            significantly out of date as some files were either missing or named incorrectly, which caused me a great
            deal
            of confusion.</p>
          <p>I injured my wrist this before starting this week&rsquo;s activities which made me fall behind again as I
            was unable to type which is not ideal due to the ever-increasing workload of this module.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Evaluation</u></strong></p>
          <p>The unit provided an insightful exploration of quantitative methods, focusing on descriptive statistics,
            measures of location, and measures of spread. These concepts were useful for understanding how to analyse
            and summarise data effectively. However, the discrepancies between the recommended reading and the content
            on the learning platform were disappointing. The promised focus on questionnaire design was instead replaced
            with unrelated examples, which lacked relevance to computer science. This mismatch significantly hampered my
            learning experience. Additionally, the outdated seminar preparation worksheets added confusion, as they
            lacked clear organisation and included missing or mislabelled files.</p>
          <p>Despite these challenges, the foundational knowledge of quantitative methods gained during this unit has
            proven to be valuable. It strengthened my ability to classify data, calculate descriptive measures, and
            interpret their implications, which are crucial for statistical analysis in research.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Analysis</u></strong></p>
          <p>The inconsistency between the assigned readings and the learning platform highlighted a gap in the course's
            structure and delivery. The focus on data visualisation and statistical analysis in the readings was a
            missed opportunity to reinforce questionnaire design, which was stated as the week's focus. This
            misalignment made it difficult to directly connect the material to practical applications in computer
            science, where contextually relevant examples would have been more impactful. Additionally, the outdated
            seminar preparation worksheets presented logistical challenges, detracting from the overall learning
            experience. Despite these issues, the unit successfully introduced foundational statistical concepts,
            enabling a better understanding of data summarisation techniques.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
          <p>While the unit succeeded in covering the fundamentals of quantitative methods, it fell short in aligning
            supplementary resources and activities with the stated goals. Ensuring that all course materials are
            updated, well-organised, and relevant to the module's goals would significantly improve the learning
            experience. Greater effort is necessary to tailor examples and activities to the field of computer science,
            enhancing the module's overall relevance and effectiveness.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Action plan</u></strong></p>
          <p>Use external resources, such as online tutorials or textbooks, to fill gaps in understanding and
            reinforce concepts like questionnaire design and data visualisation.</p>

          <h5>How the artefact relates to the module objectives</h5>
          <p>The Unit 6 Reflection in the Research Methods and Professional Practice module aligns with the module
            objectives by encouraging students to critically assess their learning experience related to quantitative
            methods, descriptive and inferential statistics, and hypothesis testing. This reflection is an essential
            component of professional and academic growth, allowing students to evaluate their understanding of
            statistical techniques, their application in research, and the challenges they faced in analysing data.</p>
          <p>One of the key module objectives is to appraise the principles of academic investigation and apply them to
            a research topic in the applicable computing field. Through reflection, students consolidate their
            understanding of data collection, statistical analysis, and hypothesis testing, which are crucial elements
            of academic investigation. The reflection provides an opportunity to consider how these methods apply to
            computing research, such as in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, or data science, where statistical
            analysis is used to validate models, assess system performance, and draw data-driven conclusions. By
            reflecting on their experience, students can identify strengths and areas for improvement in applying
            statistical methods to their research.</p>
          <p>Another significant module objective is to evaluate critically existing literature, research design, and
            methodology, including data analysis processes. The Unit 6 Reflection allows students to assess how well
            they understood and applied descriptive and inferential statistics, recognising potential errors or
            misconceptions in their approach. It also enables students to critique the reliability and validity of
            statistical methods they encountered in the literature. By engaging with statistical concepts in a practical
            context, students can better evaluate research papers that use quantitative methods, distinguishing between
            well-structured analyses and flawed methodologies. This critical engagement strengthens their ability to
            assess the credibility and applicability of research findings in computing.</p>
          <p>The reflection also supports the objective of appraising the professional, legal, social, cultural, and
            ethical issues that affect computing professionals. In computing research, ethical considerations play a
            crucial role in data analysis and interpretation. Reflecting on Unit 6 allows students to consider ethical
            issues such as data manipulation, p-hacking, and misrepresentation of statistical results, which can lead to
            misleading conclusions. This is particularly relevant in fields such as machine learning, cybersecurity, and
            software engineering, where research findings can significantly impact decision-making. By acknowledging
            these concerns in their reflection, students reinforce the importance of transparency, accuracy, and ethical
            responsibility in computing research.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the module objective of producing and critically evaluating a research proposal is reinforced
            through the Unit 6 Reflection. A well-structured research proposal requires a solid understanding of data
            analysis methods, hypothesis testing, and statistical reasoning. Reflecting on Unit 6 helps students
            recognise which statistical tools are most appropriate for their research and how they can integrate
            quantitative analysis into their study design. This reflection also allows students to identify gaps in
            their statistical knowledge, ensuring they take proactive steps to improve before finalising their research
            proposals.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, the Unit 6 Reflection plays a vital role in meeting the module&rsquo;s objectives by
            enabling students to critically assess their statistical knowledge, ethical considerations, and application
            of quantitative methods in computing research. By engaging in this reflective process, students develop a
            deeper understanding of statistical reasoning, enhance their ability to critically evaluate research, and
            refine their approach to research design and methodology. Ultimately, this reflection contributes to their
            academic development, professional growth, and ability to conduct rigorous and ethical computing
            research.</p>
