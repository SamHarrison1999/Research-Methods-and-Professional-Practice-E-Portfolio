            <p>Moreover, the Self-Test Quiz contributes to the objective of producing and critically evaluating a
              research proposal for a chosen topic. Since the module has guided students through the entire research
              process&mdash;from identifying research questions to designing methodologies and analysing data&mdash;the
              quiz helps assess their ability to justify research design choices. It also ensures that students
              understand key concepts such as hypothesis formulation, ethical considerations, and data-driven
              decision-making, which are crucial for developing a well-structured research proposal.</p>
            <p>Beyond assessing knowledge, the Self-Test Quiz also supports self-directed learning and professional
              development. By reviewing quiz results, students can identify gaps in their knowledge and take proactive
              steps to address them, reinforcing the importance of lifelong learning and continuous improvement. The
              quiz encourages students to engage in critical reflection on their learning journey, helping them develop
              a growth mindset that will benefit their future academic and professional pursuits.</p>
            <p>In summary, the Self-Test Quiz plays an integral role in ensuring that students have achieved the
              learning outcomes of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module. It allows students to test
              their comprehension of key research principles, ethical considerations, and data analysis techniques,
              ensuring that they are well-prepared to apply these skills in academic research and industry settings. By

          <h5 id="reflection">Reflection</h5>
          <p><strong><u>Description</u></strong></p>
          <p>This unit was the final unit of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module, focusing on project
            management and managing risk. The goals of this unit were to explore the principles of project management,
            project methodologies, and project life cycles, analyse how risks and constraints impact project outcomes,
            develop a risk management plan, understand how to implement effective change control processes to manage
            project scope and maintain quality, and learn how to integrate risk and change management strategies into
            projects.</p>
          <p>For this unit, we were required to read chapters 1, 3, 6, and 11 from Project Management for Engineering,
            Business, and Technology (Nicholas &amp; Steyn, 2020), A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
            (Project Management Institute, 2020), an article on project management (Hart, 2023), an article on project
            management using agile frameworks (Mircea, 2019), a webpage on Gantt Charts from the Association for Project
            Management (APM, 2023), and an article on AI for space traffic management (Manfletti et al., 2023).</p>
          <p>The module reflection and e-portfolio were due in this unit, and the only formative activity for this unit
            was the self-test quiz.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Feelings</u></strong></p>
          <p>Completing this final unit was both a rewarding and challenging experience. I felt a sense of
            accomplishment as I reflected on my progress throughout the module. However, I also experienced frustration
            due to inconsistencies between the reading lists provided on the learning platform and those outlined in the
            syllabus. This made it difficult to determine which materials were essential, leading to inefficiencies in
            my study process.</p>
          <p>Despite this, I found the practical application of project management concepts engaging, especially in
            understanding risk management and change control processes. These topics provided valuable insights into
            real-world project implementation. However, I was slightly overwhelmed by the breadth of project management
            methodologies covered, as I had limited prior experience with structured project planning frameworks.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Evaluation</u></strong></p>
          <p>A key strength of this unit was its focus on practical project management principles, particularly risk
            assessment and mitigation strategies. The content was highly applicable to professional settings, and
            learning about different project management methodologies (e.g. Agile and Waterfall) helped me appreciate
            their use in different contexts. The readings from Nicholas and Steyn (2020) provided a solid theoretical
            foundation, while case studies illustrated how these methodologies are applied in real-world projects.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>However, the lack of structured formative activities meant there was minimal opportunity to receive
            feedback before the final submission. Additionally, the inconsistencies in the reading materials created
            confusion, which could have been avoided with better alignment between the syllabus and the online platform.
            The self-test quiz was useful for reinforcing key concepts but did not provide a comprehensive assessment of
            my understanding.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Analysis</u></strong></p>
          <p>The challenges I faced in this unit highlighted the importance of effective time management and information
            synthesis. The discrepancies in the reading list reinforced the need for independent verification of
            resources, a skill that is essential for any research-driven work. The emphasis on risk management also
            provided a deeper understanding of proactive decision-making, which is crucial in project execution.</p>
          <p>A key learning point was the realisation that project risks are not always negative&mdash;some risks
            present opportunities that, if managed correctly, can lead to innovation and competitive advantage (Project
            Management Institute, 2020). This perspective changed how I viewed risk management, shifting my focus from
            risk avoidance to risk optimisation.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the introduction to Gantt charts (APM, 2023) and Agile methodologies (Mircea, 2019) was
            particularly useful. These tools will be valuable in future research and professional projects, allowing for
            better organisation and adaptability.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
          <p>This unit provided a strong foundation in project management, highlighting the importance of structured
            planning, risk assessment, and change management. While I successfully engaged with the content, there were
            areas where I could have improved, such as dedicating more time to exploring specific project management
            software tools.</p>
          <p>Moving forward, I aim to refine my project planning and risk management skills by applying these concepts
            in real-world settings. The inconsistencies in the reading lists also taught me the importance of
            cross-referencing academic materials to ensure I am accessing the most relevant and up-to-date
            information.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Action plan</u></strong></p>
          <p>To build on the knowledge and skills gained in this unit, I will take several strategic actions to
            strengthen my project management and risk assessment abilities. First, I will deepen my understanding of
            project management software tools such as Jira. These tools are essential for task management, scheduling,
            and tracking risks, which will be beneficial for both academic and professional projects. By completing
            online tutorials and applying these tools to personal or collaborative projects, I aim to enhance my ability
            to organise tasks efficiently and monitor project progress effectively.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>A key takeaway from this unit was the importance of risk management in project execution. To further
            develop this skill, I will practice identifying, categorising, and mitigating risks by using frameworks such
            as the Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS). I will also analyse case studies of successful and failed projects to
            understand how risk assessment impacts decision-making. Additionally, I plan to explore risk management
            certifications, such as the PMI Risk Management Professional (PMI-RMP), to gain a more structured approach
            to handling project uncertainties.</p>
          <p>Time management is another critical area for improvement. Throughout this module, I faced challenges in
            balancing multiple assignments, especially when reading lists were inconsistent. To address this, I will
            implement time-blocking techniques and make use of Gantt charts to structure my workload more effectively.
            This will ensure that I allocate enough time to research, writing, and reflection, reducing last-minute
            stress and improving the quality of my work.</p>
          <p>Finally, I recognise the value of professional certifications in validating my skills and increasing
            employability. Over the next year, I will work towards getting a project management certification, such as
            the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM). These credentials will not only reinforce my
            theoretical knowledge but also provide practical frameworks for managing real-world projects successfully.
            By integrating these strategies into my professional development plan, I aim to apply the project management
            and risk management concepts learned in this unit effectively in my future career.</p>

            design selection, and data analysis methodologies. Throughout the module, students have developed an
            understanding of how to formulate research questions, select appropriate methodologies, and justify their
            research decisions. The reflection allows students to assess how effectively they applied these principles
            to their own research proposal, demonstrating their ability to integrate theoretical and practical knowledge
            in academic investigation.</p>
          <p>Another key objective of the module is to evaluate critically existing literature, research design, and
            methodology for the chosen research topic. The Unit 12 Reflection enables students to assess how their
            ability to analyse and critique existing studies, methodologies, and research frameworks has improved. By
            revisiting experiences such as the Peer Review Activity, Literature Review Plan, and Hypothesis Testing
            Worksheets, students can reflect on their capacity to evaluate academic sources, synthesise findings, and
            identify research gaps. This reflection process is essential in demonstrating critical thinking and research
            literacy, which are fundamental for producing high-quality academic work in computing research.</p>
          <p>The final objective of the module is to produce and evaluate critically a research proposal for the chosen

            well-structured and methodologically sound research proposal. It allows students to identify strengths and
            areas for improvement in their research planning, data collection strategies, and analysis techniques. By
            considering feedback received on their research proposal, students can assess how their approach to
            designing and justifying research has developed over the course of the module. This reflective process
            ensures that students leave the module with a strong foundation in research proposal development, equipping
            them with essential skills for academic and professional research projects.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the Unit 12 Reflection encourages students to consider their broader professional development
            and future learning goals. This aligns with the module&rsquo;s focus on continuous professional development
            (CPD) and employability skills. By reflecting on challenges faced and lessons learned, students can develop
            an action plan for improving their technical competencies, critical thinking skills, and professional
            communication abilities. This reflective practice ensures that students carry forward the skills and
            knowledge gained throughout the module, applying them effectively in future research endeavours and
            professional roles in the computing industry.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, the Unit 12 Reflection plays a crucial role in reinforcing the learning objectives of the
            Research Methods and Professional Practice module. It provides students with the opportunity to evaluate
            their growth, critically assess their research capabilities, and document their understanding of ethical,
            legal, and methodological considerations in computing research. By engaging in this reflection, students not
            only demonstrate their ability to apply academic research principles and methodologies but also establish a
