            <h5 id="literatureReviewFormative">Literature Review Outline</h5>
            <p>Research Topic: AI-based assistive technology for the physically disabled and/or the elderly</p>
            <p><strong><u>What is the focus and aim of your review? Who is your audience?</u></strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>How can assistive technology improve a disabled person's quality of life?</li>
              <li>What are the benefits of AI-based assistive technology?</li>
              <li>What are the ethical, legal and social concerns relevant to assistive technology, more specifically AI
                based assistive technology?
              </li>
              <li>What are the drawbacks to assistive technology? (cost, negative perception etc.)</li>
              <li>The target audience is the disabled, the elderly and their carers
                <ul>
                  <li>The goal is to educate them on the assistive technologies available to them</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong><u>Why is there a need for your review? Why is it significant?</u></strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Because some people with disabilities may not be aware of the assistive technologies available to them
                <ul>
                  <li>Possible reasons for this; they were diagnosed later in life so may not have been aware of their
                    disabilities, they were unaware of the assistive technologies available to them, they may have severe mental
                    deficiencies so they may be unable to understand the information that has been provided to them on
                    assistive technologies in the past
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Assistive technologies could help to safeguard the vulnerable
              </li>
              <li>Assistive technologies could improve the quality of life for people with severe disabilities</li>
              <li>Assistive technologies can help people who struggle with daily living activities and may allow them
                to become more independent
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong><u>What is the context of the topic or issue? What perspective do you take? What framework do you
              use to synthesise the literature?</u></strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The context of the topic is going to be centred around how assistive technologies can improve
                vulnerable people&rsquo;s quality of life allowing them to be more independent
              </li>
              <li>While I will mainly be looking at the perspective of how assistive technology has improved their life,
                I will also touch on the drawbacks of assistive technology such as the overreliance on it.
              </li>
              <li>I will be using Chris Hart&rsquo;s book on literature reviews (Hart, 2018) in conjunction with Harris
                Cooper&rsquo;s article on literature reviews (Cooper, 1988) for guidance when writing the literature
                review
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong><u>How did you locate and select sources for inclusion in the review?</u></strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sources were located through a series of keyword searches on Google Scholar and Google. I also discussed
                assistive technologies with my DSA mentor due to their experience working with people with
                disabilities; they were more aware of the types of assistive technologies available in the market today.
              </li>
              <li>Documents that weren&rsquo;t written or translated into English were excluded as that is the only
                language I can understand.
              </li>
              <li>Documents that didn&rsquo;t come from reputable sources were excluded as they haven&rsquo;t been
                checked for accuracy
              </li>
              <li>It was important to find academic articles that argued both for and against the use of AI-assistive
                technologies

              Concerning the Application of Trustworthy AI</u></strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The article by Dr Kristi Joamets and Dr Archil Chochia looks at the legal, social and ethical issues
                of ai-based assistive technologies for those with disabilities
              </li>
              <li>They argue that a national policy to enforce the rights of disabled people is needed</li>
              <li>As a vulnerable adult myself, I found the article to be rather informative</li>
              <li>Strengths:
                <ul>
                  <li>Highlights the ability of assistive technologies to improve a disabled person's quality of life
                  </li>
                  <li>Highlights how Artificial Intelligence can enhance assistive technologies</li>
                  <li>Emphasises the importance of trustworthy AI referencing relevant EU legislation and ethical
                    guidelines
                  </li>
                  <li>Provided a solid background on the laws surrounding Artificial Intelligence and the rights of
                    people with disabilities
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Weaknesses:
                <ul>
                  <li>The article heavily focused on European legal and ethical standards. The article could have
                    benefited from providing more of a global perspective on the relevant legal, social and ethical
                    legislation for AI-based assistive technologies.
                    <ul>
                      <li>What about the relevant legislation in regions other than Europe?</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>The article could have gone into more detail on the benefits, risks and limitations of AI as they
                    only looked at them at a high level.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Further Research:

            <ul>
              <li>Assistive technologies help people with disabilities and the elderly regain their own independence
                improving their overall quality of life and self-confidence
              </li>
              <li>Assistive technologies have use cases across all aspects of everyday life</li>
              <li>Even though there are tons of benefits to assistive technology, particularly for the disabled and
                elderly, there are some potential concerns regarding the technology such as over-reliance on the technology and
                privacy concerns
              </li>
              <li>In less economically developed countries, the elderly and disabled don&rsquo;t have access to
                assistive technologies
              </li>
              <li>Due to the cost, those who have a genuine need for assistive technology may not have access to the
                technology
              </li>

              <li>Data was limited as excluded non-English sources

              </li>
              <li>Sources demonstrate multiple viewpoints</li>
              <li>The medical field is constantly evolving so old sources may not be relevant
                <ul>
                  <li>E.G. Asperger's got renamed to ASD due to the history of Hans Asperger and his links to the Nazis
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

            <h5>How the literature review outline relates to the module objectives</h5>
            <p>The Literature Review Outline, is a crucial artefact that
              directly aligns with several module objectives in the Research Methods and Professional Practice module. It
              serves as a foundational step in conducting academic research, helping me develop my critical thinking,
              analytical skills, and an understanding of existing research in my chosen area of study. Through this
              artefact, I demonstrated my ability to appraise existing literature, construct a structured review,
              and apply research principles to my chosen topic.</p>
            <p>One of the core module objectives is to appraise the principles of academic investigation and apply them to
              a research topic in the applicable computing field. The literature review outline enabled me to engage
              with these principles by identifying relevant sources, summarising key arguments, and evaluating the
              strengths and limitations of existing research. By organising my review in a structured manner, I
              practised the systematic approach required for academic research, ensuring that my study is grounded in
              scholarly work and builds upon established knowledge in the field.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the module required me to evaluate critically existing literature, research design, and
              methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes. The literature review outline supports
              this objective by guiding students to assess previous research studies, compare different perspectives, and
              identify gaps in knowledge. By doing so, I refined my understanding of how different research
              methodologies are applied within computing-related research and developed an informed rationale for my own
              studies. This process strengthened my ability to critically analyse research, recognise trends, and justify
              methodological choices.</p>
            <p>Another key objective of the module is to appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical
              issues that affect computing professionals. The literature review outline allowed me to explore these
              aspects by analysing how existing research addresses or neglects such issues. Many research topics in
              computing, such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, data privacy, and digital ethics, have
              significant professional and societal implications. By structuring a literature review, I developed a
              broad awareness of ethical and legal considerations, helping me integrate responsible research practices
              into my studies.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the literature review outline is a critical precursor to the research proposal, which aligns with
              the module objective to produce and critically evaluate a research proposal for the chosen topic. A
              well-structured literature review informs the problem statement, research questions, and justification for
              the selected methodology in a research proposal. By conducting a thorough review of relevant literature,
              I ensured my research proposal was theoretically informed, methodologically sound, and aligned
              with academic standards.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the literature review outline plays a vital role in helping students achieve the Research
              Methods and Professional Practice module objectives. It strengthened my ability to analyse and synthesise
              academic sources, critically evaluate research methodologies, consider ethical implications, and laid a
              strong foundation for my research proposal. By engaging in this structured review, I developed
              essential academic and professional research skills, ensuring that my study contributes meaningfully to
              the broader field of computing.</p>

          <p><strong><u>Case Study on Privacy</u></strong></p>
          <p><strong><u>If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, should he release the names and
            addresses?</u></strong></p>
          <p>Ricardo should not release the information because it could be considered a breach of confidentiality,
            because he doesn&rsquo;t have permission to release the information and because it could cause legal
            issues.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Suppose Ricardo were responsible for determining allowable access to the files. What ethical
            issues would be involved in his deciding whether to grant access to Beth?</u></strong></p>
          <p>The ethical issues Ricardo would need to consider are related to an individual&rsquo;s right to privacy
            against the potential scientific benefit. He would have to make sure that he has obtained informed consent,
            is not abusing his position, hasn&rsquo;t set any precedent and isn't breaking any legal or institutional
            policies.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Should Beth be allowed to contact the individuals involved? That is, should the Records
            department release individuals' names to a researcher? What are the ethical issues for the Records
            department to consider?</u></strong></p>
          <p>The ethical issues the Records department must consider are related to the individual&rsquo;s right to
            privacy, consent, public trust, confidentiality and potential harm before deciding whether Beth
            should be allowed to contact the individuals involved in the study.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Suppose Beth contacts the individuals to ask their permission, and one-third of them respond
            giving permission, one-third respond denying permission, and one-third do not respond. Beth claims that at

            Beth?</u></strong>
          </p>
          <p>There are several options available to Beth; she could limit her study to the individuals who gave
            permission, she could consult an ethical review board for guidance, she could reattempt to contact those who
            did not respond, or she could modify her research design.</p>
          <br>
          <h5>How the case study on privacy relates to the module objectives</h5>
          <p>The case study on privacy is a
            key artefact that directly supports several module objectives. This activity involves examining privacy
            issues, ethical considerations, and data protection laws, all of which are crucial topics in computing
            research and professional practice. By engaging with this case study, I developed my ability to
            analyse professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical issues, a core objective of the module.</p>
          <p>A primary module objective is to appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical issues
            that affect computing professionals. The case study on privacy directly addresses this by encouraging
            students to evaluate the impact of privacy concerns on individuals, organisations, and society. Given the
            increasing importance of data privacy laws, such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA
            (California Consumer Privacy Act), computing professionals must be aware of their responsibilities when
            handling user data. This case study allowed me to explore these legal frameworks, ethical dilemmas, and
            best practices for ensuring compliance and protecting user privacy.</p>
          <p>The case study also aligns with the module objective to evaluate critically existing literature, research
            design, and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes. Privacy concerns are often
            explored through qualitative and quantitative research methods, such as case studies, surveys, and policy
            analysis. Through this activity, I gained insights into how privacy research is conducted, including
            methodological challenges in studying user behaviour, ethical constraints in data collection, and the role
            of regulations in shaping research practices. This helped me build a foundation for evaluating research
            methodologies in computing, particularly those related to cybersecurity, AI ethics, and information
            security.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the case study on privacy supports the module objective to appraise the principles of
            academic investigation and apply them to a research topic in the applicable computing field. By analysing
            privacy concerns within a structured case study format, I got to practice applying critical thinking,
            interpreting real-world scenarios, and synthesising academic and legal sources. This mirrors the process of
            academic research, where case studies are commonly used to explore real-world implications of theoretical
            frameworks. I also developed problem-solving skills as I considered potential solutions to the ethical
            and legal challenges presented in the case study.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, this activity contributes to the module objective to produce and critically evaluate a
            research proposal for the chosen topic. Privacy is a critical research area in computing, and students who
            engage with this case study can use their insights to formulate research questions, justify methodological
            choices, and identify ethical considerations in their research proposal. Understanding privacy-related
            risks and solutions enhanced my ability to design responsible, well-informed studies that align
            with industry standards and ethical research guidelines.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, the Case Study on Privacy is a valuable learning tool that helps students achieve the
            Research Methods and Professional Practice module objectives. It provides an opportunity to explore legal
            and ethical issues, critically evaluate privacy research, apply academic investigation principles, and
            enhance research proposal development skills. Through this activity, I gained essential knowledge and
            competencies that will be applicable in both academic research and professional computing roles,
            particularly in areas such as cybersecurity, AI ethics, and data protection.</p>
          <!-- Reflection Section -->
          <h5 id="reflection">Reflection</h5>
          <p><strong><u>Description</u></strong></p>
          <p>Unit 4 of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module provided an in-depth exploration of
            qualitative research methods, with a focus on case studies, focus groups, and observational techniques. The
            unit aimed to develop a deeper understanding of how these methods contribute to data collection and
            analysis, particularly in areas where numerical data alone does not fully capture the complexity of a
            research problem. The content covered the advantages and limitations of qualitative methods, ethical
            considerations, and how these methods differ from quantitative approaches.</p>
          <p>A key component of this unit was the Case Study on Privacy, which required us to analyse an ethical
            scenario related to data security and privacy concerns in research. This exercise encouraged critical
            engagement with ethical dilemmas and challenged me to consider how qualitative research informs policy
            recommendations and technological developments. Additionally, working on the Literature Review Outline
            allowed me to structure my approach to reviewing existing studies, ensuring that I could critically assess
            prior research and identify gaps relevant to my topic.</p>
          <p>Through this unit, I gained valuable insights into how qualitative research is fundamental in fields such
            as artificial intelligence ethics, cybersecurity, and human-computer interaction, where understanding human
            behaviour and decision-making processes is crucial. These activities provided a strong foundation for
            designing and conducting research that integrates qualitative perspectives alongside quantitative
            methods.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Feelings</u></strong></p>
          <p>At the start of the unit, I felt somewhat uncertain about qualitative research methods, as my previous
            experience had been more focused on statistical and numerical data analysis. The subjective nature of
            qualitative data led me to question its reliability and validity, particularly in comparison to the
            structured and objective nature of quantitative analysis.</p>
          <p>However, as I progressed through the unit, my perspective began to change. The Case Study on Privacy
            highlighted the ethical implications of research methodologies, making me realise that qualitative research
            is essential for understanding complex societal and ethical issues that cannot always be quantified. I began
            to appreciate how case studies, focus groups, and observational research allow researchers to capture rich,
            contextual insights that numerical data alone may overlook.</p>
          <p>By the end of the unit, I felt more confident in my ability to apply qualitative research methods
            effectively. I also recognised the importance of ethical considerations when conducting research with human
            participants. While I still have a natural inclination towards quantitative analysis, I now understand that
            qualitative and quantitative approaches are complementary and that both are necessary for a well-rounded
            research study.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Evaluation</u></strong></p>
          <p>Unit 4 provided valuable learning opportunities and helped me broaden my research skills beyond
            quantitative methods. One of my key strengths was my ability to critically engage with ethical
            considerations in research. The Case Study on Privacy allowed me to reflect on the responsibilities of
            researchers when dealing with sensitive data, reinforcing the importance of informed consent, anonymity, and
            data security (Smith, 2021). This activity helped me develop a more ethical and responsible approach to
            research design.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the Literature Review Outline was beneficial in structuring my research process. Initially, I
            found it challenging to synthesise multiple sources and identify key themes within the existing literature.
            However, by organising my review into clearly defined sections and categorising sources based on relevance,
            I was able to develop a coherent narrative for my research. This experience reinforced the importance of
            systematic literature reviews in forming a strong research foundation (Creswell &amp; Poth, 2018).</p>
          <p>Despite these strengths, I encountered some difficulties, particularly in understanding how to ensure
            rigour and validity in qualitative research. Unlike quantitative research, which uses statistical tests to
            establish reliability, qualitative research relies on techniques such as triangulation, member checking, and
            reflexivity (Bryman, 2016). Initially, these concepts were challenging to grasp, but engaging with
            additional reading materials helped me develop a clearer understanding of how qualitative research can
            maintain credibility and trustworthiness.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Analysis</u></strong></p>
          <p>The activities in Unit 4 reinforced the importance of qualitative research in understanding human behaviour
            and social phenomena. Through the Case Study on Privacy, I realised that ethical considerations should be
            integrated into the research design from the outset. This was a significant realisation, as I had previously
            assumed that ethics was primarily a concern during the data collection phase. However, this activity made me
            aware that research ethics should inform every stage of a study, from the formulation of research questions
            to the interpretation and presentation of findings (Smith, 2021).</p>
          <p>Additionally, the Literature Review Outline helped me appreciate the value of systematically analysing
            existing research. Before this unit, I struggled with organising sources and distinguishing relevant studies
            from peripheral ones. However, after completing the outline, I recognised how a well-structured literature
            review can provide a strong theoretical framework for a research project. It also helped me see how
            different studies are interconnected, allowing me to identify gaps and opportunities for further
            research.</p>
          <p>Another key learning point was recognising that qualitative research is highly flexible and adaptable.
            Unlike quantitative research, which often follows predefined variables and hypotheses, qualitative research
            allows for emergent themes and evolving questions (Creswell &amp; Poth, 2018). This flexibility is
            particularly valuable in fields such as technology ethics and cybersecurity, where rapidly evolving trends
            require adaptive research approaches. This realisation has encouraged me to incorporate qualitative
            techniques into my future research projects, particularly when exploring topics that involve human
            decision-making and user experiences.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
          <p>Unit 4 significantly enhanced my understanding of qualitative research methods and their ethical
            considerations. Initially, I was sceptical about the reliability of qualitative data, but by engaging with
            case studies and literature reviews, I developed a deeper appreciation for its role in capturing complex
            social and behavioural patterns. I also learned that ethical considerations must be embedded throughout the
            research process, ensuring that research participants' rights and privacy are protected.</p>
          <p>Although I made significant progress in understanding qualitative research methodologies, I recognise that
            I still need to improve my ability to evaluate qualitative data critically. Additionally, I need to refine
            my skills in synthesising academic literature effectively, ensuring that my research builds on existing
            knowledge in a structured and coherent manner.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Action Plan</u></strong></p>
          <p>To further develop my qualitative research skills and literature review techniques, I will take several
            steps. First, I will engage with additional academic resources, such as Creswell &amp; Poth (2018) and Braun
            &amp; Clarke (2021), to strengthen my understanding of thematic analysis and coding techniques. These
            readings will provide me with a more comprehensive framework for conducting qualitative research and
            ensuring validity.</p>
          <p>Second, I plan to practise structuring literature reviews by summarising key research papers and mapping
            out how different studies connect. This will help me develop a more systematic approach to synthesising
            literature, ensuring that I can clearly articulate the theoretical foundation of my research.</p>
          <p>Third, I will actively seek feedback from peers and instructors to enhance my ability to evaluate
            qualitative research findings critically. Engaging in discussions and receiving constructive feedback will
            help me refine my analytical and writing skills, ensuring that I can effectively interpret and present
            qualitative data.</p>
          <p>Finally, I will explore opportunities to apply qualitative research methods in practical projects, such as
            conducting interviews or focus groups on topics related to user experiences in technology. By gaining
            hands-on experience, I will develop greater confidence in applying qualitative techniques and understanding
            their implications for research and policy recommendations.</p>
          <p>By implementing these strategies, I aim to further develop my research expertise, particularly in
            qualitative methodologies, ensuring that I can conduct comprehensive and ethically responsible research in
            both academic and professional settings.</p>

          <h5>How the reflection relates to the module objectives</h5>
          <p>The Unit 4 Reflection in the Research Methods and Professional Practice module serves as an essential
            artefact that supports the achievement of several module objectives. Reflecting on case studies, focus
            groups, and observations, this unit encourages students to critically assess qualitative research methods
            and their implications in computing research. By engaging with this reflection, I enhanced my
            ability to appraise professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical issues that affect computing
            professionals, a core objective of the module.</p>
          <p>One of the key module objectives is to evaluate critically existing literature, research design, and
            methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes. The Unit 4 Reflection contributes to
            this objective by prompting students to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of different qualitative
            research methods. Case studies, focus groups, and observations are widely used in computing research to
            explore user experiences, software usability, and ethical concerns. Through this reflection, I assessed
            when and how to use these methods effectively, considering aspects such as bias, reliability, and validity.
            This critical evaluation helped me to develop a deeper understanding of research methodologies in
            computing.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the reflection aligns with the module objective to appraise the principles of academic
            investigation and apply them to a research topic in the applicable computing field. Reflecting on
            theoretical and practical aspects of qualitative data collection allowed me to connect academic
            research principles with real-world applications. For instance, how case studies inform
            cybersecurity policies, how focus groups shape user experience research, or how observational methods
            contribute to human-computer interaction studies. This understanding allowed me to apply these
            academic principles to my own research projects.</p>
          <p>The Unit 4 Reflection also supports the objective to produce and evaluate critically the resulting research
            proposal for the chosen topic. As I had to reflect on qualitative research methods, I gained insights into
            which data collection techniques are suitable for my own investigations. This process helped me justify
            my methodological choices in my research proposal, ensuring that my study design is ethically
            sound, methodologically appropriate, and aligned with their research questions. Additionally, reflecting on
            ethical considerations in qualitative research&mdash;such as participant confidentiality, informed consent,
            and potential researcher bias&mdash;helped me incorporate strong ethical justifications into my
            research proposal.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, this reflection contributes to professional and ethical awareness in computing research. Since
            qualitative research often involves direct engagement with participants, it raises important ethical and
            legal issues, such as data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR), informed consent, and researcher neutrality. By
            reflecting on these concerns, I enhanced my ability to navigate ethical challenges in computing
            research, aligning with the module objective to appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural, and
            ethical issues that affect computing professionals.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, the Unit 4 Reflection is a critical learning tool that directly supports the Research
            Methods and Professional Practice module objectives. It enables students to critically evaluate qualitative
            research methodologies, apply academic investigation principles, consider ethical issues, and refine their
            research proposals. Through this reflective practice, I developed a well-rounded understanding of
            research methods in computing, which will be valuable in both academic and professional research
            settings.</p>
