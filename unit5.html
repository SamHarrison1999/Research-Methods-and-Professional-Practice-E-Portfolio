            <!-- Reflective Activity 2 - Inappropriate Use of Surveys Case Study -->
            <h5 id="InappropriateUseOfSurveysActivity">Inappropriate Use of Surveys Case Study Reflective Activity</h5>
            <p>The Cambridge Analytica scandal (Confessore, 2018) is a high-profile example of how surveys can be
              manipulated to gather personal data for alternative purposes. Cambridge Analytica accessed data from
              approximately 87 million Facebook users through a personality quiz app even though only 270 thousand
              people
              took the survey as they also collected data from the participants' Facebook friends, they then used this
              data to build psychological profiles for targeted political ads for the 2016 US presidential election.</p>
            <p>Other high-profile examples of companies who have used surveys inappropriately are Target who in 2012
              used survey and purchase data to predict customers' life events so they could target ads to individuals
              (Duhigg, 2012) and TikTok who in 2020 used surveys intended to improve UX to collect data about their
              users for targeted advertising and financial gain (Newton, 2020).</p>
            <p>These types of exploitative surveys raise plenty of legal, social and ethical issues — for example, these
              companies could be found to be in violation of human rights laws related to informed consent as the
              victims weren&rsquo;t fully aware of how their data would be used, and they could be found to be in breach
              of privacy laws as at a result they could receive a significant fine and suffer significant reputation
              damage.</p>

            <h5 id="QuestionnaireWikiActivity">Questionnaires Wiki Activity</h5>
            <p><strong><u>Introduction </u></strong></p>
            <p>For this activity, I will analyse and critique the Census 2021 Household Questionnaire from the Office
              for National Statistics (ONS, 2021). The six specific questions I will focus on are:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><em>What is your date of birth?</em></li>
              <li><em>What is your sex?</em></li>
              <li><em>How would you describe your ethnic group?</em></li>
              <li><em>Do you have any long-term health conditions or disabilities?</em></li>
              <li><em>What is your current employment status?</em></li>
              <li><em>How many people live in your household, and what is their relationship to you?</em></li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong><u>Format and Structure Analysis </u></strong></p>
            <p>Overall, the questionnaire is clear and straightforward, using categorised sections to group similar
              questions effectively. However, its length may overwhelm some respondents, potentially affecting
              completion rates.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Question Analysis </u></strong></p>
            <p>While collecting respondents' dates of birth, provides valuable demographic data, this question may cause
              discomfort for individuals who prefer not to share their age. Additionally, the variation in date formats
              across countries could confuse respondents whose primary nationality is not English. To address these
              issues, I recommend requesting respondents' age range instead. This would provide the necessary data
              without causing confusion or discomfort.</p>
            <p>Although asking about sex is a reasonable question, the limited response options may exclude or offend
              individuals in the LGBTQIA+ community. A lack of inclusivity can lead to feelings of marginalisation. To
              avoid this, I suggest expanding the response options to include categories such as "Non-binary," "Prefer
              not to say", or an open-text option to reflect modern societal diversity.</p>
            <p>The question on ethnicity is important for collecting data on diversity. However, the response categories
              are often broad and may not adequately represent all ethnic groups. This lack of specificity could lead to
              confusion or frustration among respondents unsure of which category applies to them. Adding more granular
              options or an open-text field for "Other" would enhance inclusivity and accuracy.</p>
            <p>The question on long-term health conditions and disabilities is limited to "Yes" or "No" responses, as
              such it is overly simplistic. It misses the opportunity to gather detailed data about the nature of
              respondents' conditions or disabilities. A follow-up question allowing respondents to specify the type of
              condition would provide more meaningful insights.</p>
            <p>Whilst understanding employment status is essential for analysing labour market trends, the limited
              response options exclude less common forms of work, such as gig economy roles or unpaid caregiving. This
              question could be improved by offering a broader range of employment categories or an open-text
              option.</p>
            <p>The question about household composition requires respondents to categorise relationships into predefined
              roles, which may not reflect modern family dynamics. Adding an "Other" option or allowing respondents to
              specify relationships would accommodate diverse household arrangements.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
            <p>While the Census questionnaire is a valuable tool for collecting demographic and household data in
              England and Wales, several questions lack inclusivity and flexibility. Expanding response options to
              reflect modern societal diversity, including a section for participant feedback, and incorporating
              follow-up questions where necessary would enhance the quality and completeness of the data collected.</p>

          <!-- Reflection Section -->
          <h5 id="reflection">Reflection</h5>
          <p><strong><u>Description</u></strong></p>
          <p>This was the fifth unit of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module. The goals of this unit
            were to understand the role of interviews and surveys in research and determine their relevance to your
            study, to be able to differentiate between surveys and questionnaires and understand their unique purposes,
            to learn how to design effective questionnaires to collect qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-method data,
            to explore pre- and post-testing methods and their application in research and to be able to analyse data
            collected through interviews, surveys, and questionnaires effectively.</p>
          <p>For this unit we were required to read an extract from chapter two in the book &lsquo;Projects in Computing
            and Information Systems: A Student's Guide&rsquo; (Dawson, 2015), a paper on qualitative research (Hoepfl,
            1997), a guide on using NVivo (Allsop et al., 2022) and an article on analysing qualitative data (Learning
            for Action, 2014). In addition to the required reading, there was a lecture cast on questionnaire
            design.</p>
          <p>There were two formative activities for this unit. The first formative activity was to reflect on the
            Cambridge Analytica scandal and provide two high profile examples of inappropriate use of surveys focusing
            on the social, legal and ethical concerns. The second formative activity was to critique a questionnaire. In
            addition to the two formative activities, we were asked to think about the data collection tool we intend to
            use in the module and in the dissertation module.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Feelings</u></strong></p>
          <p>When I was accessing the learning platform, I noticed one of the references in the lecture casts pointed to
            a broken link, there were some minor grammatical errors on the learning platform and not all the references
            in the reading list were correct (the references for the articles on Analysing Qualitative Data and
            comparing Surveys and questionnaires were both listed without a date when the publication date can be found
            in the source code). I would have expected the learning platform to be checked regularly to avoid these
            issues.</p>
          <p>When I was doing the required reading for this module, I felt as though it didn't seem entirely relevant as
            we are not expected to use NVivo in this module and the other articles were rather dated.</p>
          <p>The workload for this unit was much more manageable compared to the previous units in the module up to this
            point, as such, it allowed me to spend more time catching up with the module whilst I continued working on
            PHD
            applications.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Evaluation</u></strong></p>
          <p>The aspects of the unit that I feel went well were; all goals were achieved, my academic writing
            skills improved as a result of the formative activities, and the workload was a lot more manageable with my
            other commitments.</p>
          <p>The main area where I could have improved during this unit of the module was with my time management as I
            spent a lot of time working on the formative activities this week, so I didn&rsquo;t have as much time as I
            would have liked to spend catching up with the e-portfolio.</p>
          <p>The only other negative I really had for this unit of the module was with the inconsistencies on the
            learning platform. With the referencing format changing in 2025 but still accepting the current format for
            the next year, this will most likely cause a great deal of confusion as there are multiple ways of
            referencing. In addition, the referencing on the learning platform not matching up with the current
            guidelines provided by the university raises even more potential questions on how to reference
            correctly.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Analysis</u></strong></p>
          <p>Reflecting on this unit, I recognise the overlap between the unit goals and my academic and
            professional aspirations, as I begin preparation for PHD research. This unit provided insights into the
            differences between surveys and questionnaires and their respective purposes, along with guidance on
            designing effective data collection tools. The introduction of pre- and post-testing methods was especially
            beneficial, offering strategies to enhance the validity and reliability of research data. These skills are
            directly relevant to conducting primary research, which is a significant component of my future academic
            endeavours.</p>
          <p>Despite these strengths, the learning experience was hindered by inconsistencies on the learning platform.
            Broken links, outdated references, and discrepancies in referencing formats required additional time and
            effort to address, which could have been spent on more meaningful engagement with the material. On a
            positive note, the workload for this unit was more manageable than in previous weeks, allowing me to focus
            on other responsibilities, including my PHD applications. However, my time management could have been
            better, as I spent a significant amount of time on the formative activities, leaving not enough time to
            update my e-portfolio and fully consolidate my learning.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
          <p>Overall, the unit successfully achieved its goals and provided a solid foundation for conducting and
            evaluating research. It reinforced my academic writing and critical thinking skills, which are crucial for
            my PHD journey. However, my experience highlighted areas for improvement, such as the need for consistent
            and accurate learning materials and better personal time management. Despite these challenges, I feel more
            confident in my ability to design and critique research tools, which will serve me well in future research
            projects. This unit has been instrumental in bridging the gap between my current capabilities and the
            demands of a PHD.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Action Plan</u></strong></p>
          <p>Moving forward, I plan to focus on improving my time management skills to better balance module
            requirements with other responsibilities. To achieve this, I will allocate specific time slots for different
            tasks using a digital planner to visualise deadlines and prioritise effectively.</p>
          <p>In terms of skill development, I aim to practice designing and critiquing research tools, such as surveys
            and questionnaires, beyond the scope of this module. Even though NVivo was not required for this unit, I
            plan to explore it further as familiarity with qualitative analysis software will be invaluable for my PHD
            research and dissertation. To enhance my academic writing, I will continue engaging in formative activities
            and seek feedback from peers or use tools like Grammarly to refine my work further. Lastly, I will integrate
            the skills learned in this unit into my ongoing PhD applications, emphasising my ability to conduct ethical
            and effective research, while also exploring advanced research techniques to gain a competitive edge.</p>
