            <!-- Reflective Activity 2 - Inappropriate Use of Surveys Case Study -->
            <h5 id="InappropriateUseOfSurveysActivity">Inappropriate Use of Surveys Case Study Reflective Activity</h5>
            <p>The Cambridge Analytica scandal (Confessore, 2018) is a high-profile example of how surveys can be
              manipulated to gather personal data for alternative purposes. Cambridge Analytica accessed data from
              approximately 87 million Facebook users through a personality quiz even though only 270 thousand
              people
              took the survey as they also collected data from the participants' Facebook friends, they then used this
              data to build psychological profiles for targeted political ads for the 2016 US presidential election.</p>
            <p>Other high-profile examples of companies who have used surveys inappropriately are Target who in 2012
              used survey and purchase data to predict customers' life events so they could target ads to individuals
              (Duhigg, 2012) and TikTok who in 2020 used surveys intended to improve UX to collect data about their
              users for targeted advertising and financial gain (Newton, 2020).</p>
            <p>These types of exploitative surveys raise plenty of legal, social and ethical issues — for example, these
              companies could be found to be in violation of human rights laws related to informed consent as the
              victims weren&rsquo;t fully aware of how their data would be used, and they could be found to be in breach
              of privacy laws as at a result they could receive a significant fine and suffer significant reputation
              damage.</p>

            <h5>How the inappropriate use of surveys case study relates to the module objectives</h5>
            <p>The inappropriate use of surveys case study
              plays a crucial role in supporting the module objectives by enhancing
              students' understanding of ethical research practices, survey methodology, and critical evaluation of data
              collection methods. This reflection encouraged me to examine the ethical, professional, and
              methodological implications of survey design and implementation, aligning with the key objectives of the
              module.</p>
            <p>One of the primary module objectives is to appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural, and
              ethical issues that affect computing professionals. This case study activity challenged me to
              reflect on how poorly designed or unethical surveys can lead to biased data, misrepresentation of
              findings, and ethical breaches in computing research. In fields such as data science, artificial
              intelligence, and user experience research, surveys are frequently used to gather user feedback and inform
              decision-making. By analysing real-world cases of survey misuse, I developed an awareness of common
              ethical pitfalls, such as leading questions, data privacy violations, lack of informed consent, and biased
              sampling. This helped me become a more responsible researcher who adheres to the ethical standards in
              survey-based research.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the reflective activity aligns with the module objective to appraise the principles of
              academic investigation and apply them to a research topic in the applicable computing field. Surveys are a
              common data collection tool in computing research, used for measuring user satisfaction, assessing
              software usability, or evaluating security awareness. Through this activity, I evaluated how
              flawed survey designs compromise the validity and reliability of research findings. I also explore best
              practices in survey construction, such as using neutral language, ensuring appropriate sample selection,
              and adhering to data protection regulations like GDPR. By critically examining how surveys should and
              should not be conducted, I gained insights into how to design and implement surveys effectively within
              my own research.</p>
            <p>The reflection also contributes to the objective of evaluating critically existing literature, research
              design, and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes. I analysed
              real-world survey errors, identifying how methodological flaws impact research credibility and data
              interpretation. For example, I reflected on cases where survey results were manipulated to support a
              predetermined conclusion, leading to misleading insights in decision-making processes. This critical
              evaluation helped me develop a more rigorous approach to survey methodology, ensuring that my
              research findings are based on sound data collection principles.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, this activity supports the objective to produce and evaluate critically the resulting
              research proposal for the chosen topic. As surveys are a common research method in computing-related
              investigations, reflecting on how to avoid survey biases and errors directly improved my
              ability to design robust data collection instruments. When preparing my research proposal, I
              will now be better equipped to justify my methodological choices, consider potential limitations, and
              ensure ethical compliance in my data collection strategies. This activity enhanced my ability
              to create well-structured, ethical, and methodologically sound research proposals.</p>
            <p>Finally, the inappropriate use of surveys case study activity contributes to students&rsquo;
              critical thinking and professional development. It encouraged me to think beyond simply conducting
              surveys and to consider how data collection impacts research outcomes, policymaking, and ethical
              responsibilities. In professional settings, computing professionals frequently analyse survey data to
              inform business decisions, improve software usability, or assess cybersecurity risks. Understanding the
              consequences of survey misuse ensures that students develop strong research ethics and a commitment to
              integrity in professional practice.</p>
            <h5 id="QuestionnaireWikiActivity">Questionnaires Wiki Activity</h5>
            <p><strong><u>Introduction </u></strong></p>
            <p>For this activity, I will analyse and critique the Census 2021 Household Questionnaire from the Office
              for National Statistics (ONS, 2021). The six specific questions I will focus on are:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><em>What is your date of birth?</em></li>
              <li><em>What is your sex?</em></li>
              <li><em>How would you describe your ethnic group?</em></li>
              <li><em>Do you have any long-term health conditions or disabilities?</em></li>
              <li><em>What is your current employment status?</em></li>
              <li><em>How many people live in your household, and what is their relationship to you?</em></li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong><u>Format and Structure Analysis </u></strong></p>
            <p>Overall, the questionnaire is clear and straightforward, using categorised sections to group similar
              questions effectively. However, its length may overwhelm some respondents, potentially affecting
              completion rates.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Question Analysis </u></strong></p>
            <p>While collecting respondents' dates of birth, provides valuable demographic data, this question may cause
              discomfort for individuals who prefer not to share their age. Additionally, the variation in date formats
              across countries could confuse respondents whose primary nationality is not English. To address these
              issues, I recommend requesting respondents' age range instead. This would provide the necessary data
              without causing confusion or discomfort.</p>
            <p>Although asking about sex is a reasonable question, the limited response options may exclude or offend
              individuals in the LGBTQIA+ community. A lack of inclusivity can lead to feelings of marginalisation. To
              avoid this, I suggest expanding the response options to include categories such as "Non-binary," "Prefer
              not to say", or an open-text option to reflect modern societal diversity.</p>
            <p>The question on ethnicity is important for collecting data on diversity. However, the response categories
              are often broad and may not adequately represent all ethnic groups. This lack of specificity could lead to
              confusion or frustration among respondents unsure which category applies to them. Adding more granular
              options or an open-text field for "Other" would enhance inclusivity and accuracy.</p>
            <p>The question on long-term health conditions and disabilities is limited to "Yes" or "No" responses, as
              such it is overly simplistic. It misses the opportunity to gather detailed data about the nature of
              respondents' conditions or disabilities. A follow-up question allowing respondents to specify the type of
              condition would provide more meaningful insights.</p>
            <p>Whilst understanding employment status is essential for analysing labour market trends, the limited
              response options exclude less common forms of work, such as gig economy roles or unpaid caregiving. This
              question could be improved by offering a broader range of employment categories or an open-text
              option.</p>
            <p>The question about household composition requires respondents to categorise relationships into predefined
              roles, which may not reflect modern family dynamics. Adding an "Other" option or allowing respondents to
              specify relationships would accommodate diverse household arrangements.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
            <p>While the Census questionnaire is a valuable tool for collecting demographic and household data in
              England and Wales, several questions lack inclusivity and flexibility. Expanding response options to
              reflect modern societal diversity, including a section for participant feedback, and incorporating
              follow-up questions where necessary would enhance the quality and completeness of the data collected.</p>

            <h5>How the questionnaire's activity relates to the module objectives</h5>
            <p>The questionnaires wiki activity
              directly aligns with the module objectives by fostering collaborative learning, critical analysis of
              survey methodology, and practical application of research techniques. This activity allows students to
              explore the principles of questionnaire design, engage in peer knowledge-sharing, and refine their
              understanding of data collection strategies in research.</p>
            <p>One of the key module objectives is to appraise the principles of academic investigation and apply them
              to a research topic in the applicable computing field. The questionnaire's activity facilitates this
              by encouraging students to research, design, and evaluate different types of questionnaires, considering
              factors such as question phrasing, response formats, sampling techniques, and ethical considerations. In
              computing research, questionnaires are widely used for usability testing, cybersecurity awareness
              assessments, and AI ethics studies. By participating in this collaborative activity, I gained
              insights into best practices for crafting effective survey instruments and developed a deeper appreciation
              of how data collection impacts research validity.</p>
            <p>This activity also supports the objective of evaluating critically existing literature, research design,
              and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes. Through collaborative discussions
              and contributions to the wiki, I analysed different questionnaire methodologies, explored
              common pitfalls such as bias, leading questions, and poor response design, and compared different
              approaches to survey administration (e.g., online surveys vs. face-to-face interviews). I critically
              examined real-world examples and case studies, identifying how questionnaire design influences research
              outcomes. This critical engagement strengthened my ability to assess the quality of research methods and
              apply best practices in my own projects.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the questionnaire's activity aligns with the module objective of appraising the
              professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical issues that affect computing professionals. Ethical
              considerations are crucial in survey research, particularly in computing fields where data privacy and
              informed consent are paramount. Through the wiki discussions, I explored the ethical issues related to
              data protection laws (e.g., GDPR), informed consent, respondent anonymity, and potential biases in
              question framing. This encouraged me to apply ethical principles in designing surveys, ensuring
              fairness, transparency, and reliability in data collection.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the activity helped me develop the skills necessary for producing and evaluating critically
              the research proposal for my chosen topic. Since questionnaires are a common research tool in
              computing disciplines, understanding how to construct, test, and refine them is essential for ensuring
              accurate and meaningful data collection. By engaging in collaborative discussion
              I gained a broader perspective on the different questionnaire formats and their applicability to various
              research contexts. This knowledge directly informed my ability to justify methodological choices in
              my research proposal, ensuring robust and well-founded data collection methods.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the questionnaire's wiki activity promoted teamwork, knowledge-sharing, and interdisciplinary
              collaboration. A key aspect of academic and professional development is the ability to communicate
              research ideas effectively, engage with diverse perspectives, and integrate feedback to improve research
              quality. By contributing to a shared knowledge base, I enhanced my ability to constructively
              critique and refine research methodologies, which is a valuable skill in both academia and industry.</p>
            <p>The questionnaire's wiki activity supported the Research Methods and Professional Practice module
              objectives by enhancing my understanding of survey design, ethical research practices, and
              methodological evaluation. It encouraged collaborative learning, critical thinking, and the application of
              research principles in computing contexts. Through this activity, I developed the skills to
              design, analyse, and refine questionnaires for academic and professional research, ensuring valid,
              ethical, and high-quality data collection practices.</p>

          <h5 id="reflection">Reflection</h5>
          <p><strong><u>Description</u></strong></p>
          <p>Unit 5 of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module focused on interviews, survey methods, and
            questionnaire design. This unit explored various data collection techniques, highlighting their suitability
            for qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods research. A significant part of the unit involved
            understanding the structure, purpose, and limitations of interviews, surveys, and questionnaires, with a
            particular focus on best practices for effective data collection.</p>
          <p>As part of the unit, I engaged in two key activities: the inappropriate use of surveys case study
            reflective activity and the questionnaires wiki activity. The case study activity required a critical
            evaluation of survey design flaws and ethical concerns, which helped to develop an awareness of how biased
            or poorly worded survey questions can distort research outcomes. The wiki activity involved collaboration
            with peers to discuss best practices for questionnaire design, allowing for an exchange of ideas on how to
            formulate clear, unbiased, and effective questions.</p>
          <p>Another important aspect covered in this unit was the role of questionnaire validation, including
            techniques such as pre-testing and post-testing to enhance survey accuracy. This unit reinforced the need
            for careful planning in data collection, as poorly designed surveys can lead to unreliable and invalid
            results. These insights will be particularly useful in my own research, where designing effective and
            ethical data collection tools is essential for generating meaningful findings.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Feelings</u></strong></p>
          <p>At the start of this unit, I felt relatively confident in my ability to design surveys and questionnaires,
            as I had encountered these methods in previous academic and professional settings. However, as I progressed
            through the unit, I quickly realised that survey and questionnaire design is far more intricate than I had
            initially thought. The complexities surrounding leading questions, ambiguous wording, response bias, and
            ethical considerations made me reconsider my previous assumptions.</p>
          <p>The inappropriate use of surveys case study reflective activity was particularly eye-opening, as it
            demonstrated how flawed surveys can lead to misleading conclusions. This realisation was somewhat
            frustrating, as it highlighted the extent to which surveys are often misused in real-world contexts,
            particularly in market research and political polling. However, this frustration also motivated me to
            approach my own research with greater scrutiny, ensuring that my data collection tools are designed in a way
            that minimises bias and maximises accuracy.</p>
          <p>Engaging in the questionnaire's wiki activity was a valuable and collaborative experience, as it allowed me
            to exchange perspectives with peers and refine my understanding of effective questionnaire design. However,
            I found it challenging to evaluate the validity and reliability of different questionnaire formats, as I had
            not previously considered how small changes in wording can significantly impact data accuracy. Despite this
            challenge, the activity helped me develop a more structured approach to formulating survey questions,
            reinforcing the importance of clarity, neutrality, and alignment with research objectives.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Evaluation</u></strong></p>
          <p>This unit was particularly beneficial in developing my research skills, especially in questionnaire design,
            survey methodology, and interview techniques. A major strength I gained from this unit was the ability to
            critically assess survey design flaws. Through the inappropriate use of surveys case study reflective
            activity, I learned how leading questions, ambiguous wording, and response bias can distort research
            findings (Bryman, 2016). This understanding is invaluable, as it will enable me to design robust and
            reliable data collection tools for my future research projects.</p>
          <p>Another positive aspect of this unit was the opportunity to collaborate with peers in the questionnaire's
            wiki activity. This activity reinforced the importance of peer feedback in refining research tools.
            Discussing different approaches to questionnaire design highlighted best practices and encouraged me to
            think more critically about question phrasing and structure. By engaging in these discussions, I gained new
            perspectives on how to ensure that questions are clear, unbiased, and methodologically sound.</p>
          <p>Despite these strengths, I encountered some challenges in understanding and applying questionnaire
            validation techniques. While I recognised the importance of pre-testing and post-testing, I initially
            struggled with the practical application of these methods. Ensuring that a questionnaire is both reliable
            (producing consistent results) and valid (measuring what it intends to measure) is a complex process, and I
            found myself needing to conduct additional reading to fully grasp the different validation techniques
            (Creswell &amp; Poth, 2018).</p>
          <p><strong><u>Analysis</u></strong></p>
          <p>This unit reinforced the importance of careful survey and questionnaire design in ensuring research
            integrity and validity. Before engaging in this unit, I assumed that errors in surveys were primarily the
            result of technical mistakes rather than methodological flaws. However, I now understand that issues such as
            question phrasing, response bias, and lack of pre-testing can significantly impact research outcomes
            (Saunders et al., 2019). This realisation has encouraged me to approach survey design with greater attention
            to detail, ensuring that each question serves a clear purpose and aligns with research objectives.</p>
          <p>The unit also deepened my appreciation for the role of ethics in survey methodology. The inappropriate use
            of surveys case study reflective activity demonstrated how survey data can be manipulated or misrepresented,
            leading to misleading or even harmful conclusions. Ethical guidelines such as informed consent, anonymity,
            and transparency in reporting results must be prioritised to ensure that research adheres to high
            professional and academic standards (Bell et al., 2022). This insight has encouraged me to be more critical
            of published survey data, recognising that not all surveys are designed with ethical rigour.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, this unit helped me develop a more structured approach to designing questionnaires. I learned
            that each survey question must serve a specific purpose, rather than being included simply because it seems
            relevant. This aligns with best practices in research, which emphasise the importance of construct validity&mdash;the
            extent to which a survey accurately measures what it is intended to measure (Kumar, 2019). This knowledge
            will be invaluable in future research projects, particularly when designing structured and semi-structured
            interviews.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
          <p>Unit 5 was an essential learning experience that enhanced my understanding of interviews, surveys, and
            questionnaire design. It challenged my previous assumptions about data collection, making me realise that
            minor errors in survey design can have major consequences. The unit helped me develop stronger critical
            thinking skills in evaluating the reliability, validity, and ethical considerations of survey research.</p>
          <p>Although I have made progress in understanding survey methodology, I still need to improve my ability to
            systematically apply validation techniques. Additionally, I would like to develop a greater awareness of how
            different survey formats impact response rates and data quality.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Action Plan</u></strong></p>
          <p>To build upon the knowledge and skills developed in Unit 5, I will take a structured approach to further
            improving my survey and questionnaire design capabilities. Firstly, I will engage in additional reading on
            questionnaire validation techniques, focusing on key aspects such as construct validity, reliability
            testing, and pre-testing methods. Understanding these concepts more thoroughly will enable me to design more
            reliable and valid surveys that accurately measure the intended variables. Books such as Kumar&rsquo;s <em>Research
              Methodology: A Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners</em> (2019) and Bell et al.'s <em>Business Research
              Methods</em> (2022) provide valuable insights into the best practices for ensuring survey accuracy.
            Additionally, I will review ethical guidelines from professional bodies, such as the British Psychological
            Society (BPS) and the British Computer Society (BCS), to strengthen my understanding of ethical
            considerations in survey research and ensure that my surveys adhere to high professional and academic
            standards.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I plan to practise designing and refining surveys, creating small-scale surveys and testing them
            with peers or colleagues. This will allow me to gain practical experience in identifying potential biases,
            refining question phrasing, and improving the clarity of response options. Conducting pilot tests of my
            surveys will also help in assessing whether the questions effectively capture the required data and whether
            participants interpret them as intended. By receiving constructive feedback from peers, I will be able to
            adjust and refine my survey structure to improve data reliability.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, I will actively seek feedback from lecturers regarding my
            questionnaire designs. Engaging in discussions with experts will help me to identify potential weaknesses in
            my approach and gain insights into how to structure questions more effectively. I plan to schedule
            consultations with my academic mentors and seek opportunities to participate in research groups where survey
            methodologies are a key focus. Attending webinars on data collection methods will also
            contribute to my learning, as they provide exposure to new tools and techniques used in professional
            research settings.</p>
          <p>Finally, I will explore the impact of different survey formats on response rates and data quality, as this
            is an area I found particularly challenging in Unit 5. Understanding how aspects such as survey length,
            question sequencing, and online vs paper-based formats influence participant engagement will be crucial for
            improving the effectiveness of my research tools. Reviewing case studies from business research and
            psychology journals will provide valuable examples of how different questionnaire designs affect data
            collection outcomes.</p>
          <p>By implementing this action plan, I aim to develop a stronger foundation in survey methodology, ensuring
            that I can design valid, reliable, and ethically sound questionnaires for future research. These
            improvements will not only benefit my academic work but will also be highly valuable in professional
            research and industry applications.</p>

          <h5>How the reflection relates to the module objectives</h5>
          <p>The Unit 5 Reflection directly aligns with the
            module objectives by allowing students to critically assess their learning experiences, research skills, and
            ethical considerations related to survey methods, interviews, and questionnaire design. This reflective
            practice fosters self-awareness, critical thinking, and the application of research methodologies, which are
            essential parts of the module&rsquo;s intended learning outcomes.</p>
          <p>One of the key module objectives is to appraise the principles of academic investigation and apply them to
            a research topic in the applicable computing field. Unit 5 focused on survey methods, questionnaire design,
            and interviews, all of which are fundamental data collection techniques in computing research. Through
            reflection, I was able to critically analyse my experiences with designing and evaluating surveys, identifying
            challenges, biases, and areas for improvement in my approach. By considering real-world applications,
            such as user experience studies, cybersecurity awareness surveys, and AI ethics research, I was able to apply
            theoretical knowledge to practical computing contexts.</p>
          <p>The reflection also supports the objective of evaluating critically existing literature, research design,
            and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes. By reflecting on my engagement
            with academic readings, case studies, and collaborative discussions, I was able to assess how different survey
            and interview techniques contribute to effective data collection. I explored the reliability, validity,
            and ethical considerations associated with qualitative and quantitative research methods, enhancing my
            ability to critically evaluate existing research and apply best practices in my own studies.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the Unit 5 Reflection aligns with the module objective of appraising the professional, legal,
            social, cultural, and ethical issues that affect computing professionals. Ethical considerations in survey
            research and interviews&mdash;such as informed consent, participant privacy, data security, and bias in
            question formulation&mdash;are crucial topics in computing. By reflecting on these issues, I developed
            a deeper understanding of how ethical guidelines (e.g., GDPR, ACM Code of Ethics) influence data collection
            and analysis. This awareness ensures that I am prepared to conduct ethically responsible research
            that adheres to industry standards and best practices.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the reflection supports the objective of producing and evaluating critically the resulting
            research proposal for the chosen topic. Understanding how to structure and conduct interviews, design
            effective questionnaires, and analyse survey data is crucial when formulating a research proposal. By
            reflecting on my experiences with survey methodologies, data collection challenges, and ethical dilemmas,
            I was able to refine my ability to justify methodological choices in their proposals. This reflection
            contributes to my academic and professional development, ensuring that I can design research projects with
            strong methodological foundations.</p>
          <p>In conclusion the Unit 5 Reflection helps students consolidate their learning by critically analysing their engagement
            with survey methods, interviews, and questionnaire design. By linking these experiences to academic
            principles, ethical considerations, and research methodologies, students develop a comprehensive
            understanding of data collection techniques in computing research. This reflective practice strengthened
            my ability to apply research methods effectively, justify methodological decisions, and uphold ethical
            standards in academic and professional settings, aligning with the overarching module objectives.</p>
