            <!-- Reflective Activity 2 - Inappropriate Use of Surveys Case Study -->
            <h5 id="InappropriateUseOfSurveysActivity">Inappropriate Use of Surveys Case Study Reflective Activity</h5>
            <p>The Cambridge Analytica scandal (Confessore, 2018) is a high-profile example of how surveys can be
              manipulated to gather personal data for alternative purposes. Cambridge Analytica accessed data from
              approximately 87 million Facebook users through a personality quiz app even though only 270 thousand
              people
              took the survey as they also collected data from the participants' Facebook friends, they then used this
              data to build psychological profiles for targeted political ads for the 2016 US presidential election.</p>
            <p>Other high-profile examples of companies who have used surveys inappropriately are Target who in 2012
              used survey and purchase data to predict customers' life events so they could target ads to individuals
              (Duhigg, 2012) and TikTok who in 2020 used surveys intended to improve UX to collect data about their
              users for targeted advertising and financial gain (Newton, 2020).</p>
            <p>These types of exploitative surveys raise plenty of legal, social and ethical issues — for example, these
              companies could be found to be in violation of human rights laws related to informed consent as the
              victims weren&rsquo;t fully aware of how their data would be used, and they could be found to be in breach
              of privacy laws as at a result they could receive a significant fine and suffer significant reputation
              damage.</p>

            <h5>How the artefact relates to the module objectives</h5>
            <p>The Inappropriate Use of Surveys Case Study Reflective Activity in Unit 5 of the Research Methods and
              Professional Practice module plays a crucial role in supporting the module objectives by enhancing
              students' understanding of ethical research practices, survey methodology, and critical evaluation of data
              collection methods. This reflection encourages students to examine the ethical, professional, and
              methodological implications of survey design and implementation, aligning with key objectives of the
              module.</p>
            <p>One of the primary module objectives is to appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural, and
              ethical issues that affect computing professionals. This case study activity challenges students to
              reflect on how poorly designed or unethical surveys can lead to biased data, misrepresentation of
              findings, and ethical breaches in computing research. In fields such as data science, artificial
              intelligence, and user experience research, surveys are frequently used to gather user feedback and inform
              decision-making. By analysing real-world cases of survey misuse, students develop an awareness of common
              ethical pitfalls, such as leading questions, data privacy violations, lack of informed consent, and biased
              sampling. This helps them become more responsible researchers who adhere to ethical standards in
              survey-based research.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the reflective activity aligns with the module objective to appraise the principles of
              academic investigation and apply them to a research topic in the applicable computing field. Surveys are a
              common data collection tool in computing research, used for measuring user satisfaction, assessing
              software usability, or evaluating security awareness. Through this reflection, students evaluate how
              flawed survey designs compromise the validity and reliability of research findings. They also explore best
              practices in survey construction, such as using neutral language, ensuring appropriate sample selection,
              and adhering to data protection regulations like GDPR. By critically examining how surveys should and
              should not be conducted, students gain insight into how to design and implement surveys effectively within
              their own research.</p>
            <p>The reflection also contributes to the objective of evaluating critically existing literature, research
              design, and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes. Students analyse
              real-world survey errors, identifying how methodological flaws impact research credibility and data
              interpretation. For example, they may reflect on cases where survey results were manipulated to support a
              predetermined conclusion, leading to misleading insights in decision-making processes. This critical
              evaluation helps students develop a more rigorous approach to survey methodology, ensuring that their
              research findings are based on sound data collection principles.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, this activity supports the objective to produce and evaluate critically the resulting
              research proposal for the chosen topic. As surveys are a common research method in computing-related
              investigations, reflecting on how to avoid survey biases and errors directly informs students&rsquo;
              ability to design robust data collection instruments. When preparing their research proposals, students
              will be better equipped to justify their methodological choices, consider potential limitations, and
              ensure ethical compliance in their data collection strategies. This activity thus enhances their ability
              to create well-structured, ethical, and methodologically sound research proposals.</p>
            <p>Finally, the Inappropriate Use of Surveys Case Study Reflective Activity contributes to students&rsquo;
              critical thinking and professional development. It encourages them to think beyond simply conducting
              surveys and to consider how data collection impacts research outcomes, policymaking, and ethical
              responsibilities. In professional settings, computing professionals frequently analyse survey data to
              inform business decisions, improve software usability, or assess cybersecurity risks. Understanding the
              consequences of survey misuse ensures that students develop strong research ethics and a commitment to
              integrity in professional practice.</p>
            <h5 id="QuestionnaireWikiActivity">Questionnaires Wiki Activity</h5>
            <p><strong><u>Introduction </u></strong></p>
            <p>For this activity, I will analyse and critique the Census 2021 Household Questionnaire from the Office
              for National Statistics (ONS, 2021). The six specific questions I will focus on are:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><em>What is your date of birth?</em></li>
              <li><em>What is your sex?</em></li>
              <li><em>How would you describe your ethnic group?</em></li>
              <li><em>Do you have any long-term health conditions or disabilities?</em></li>
              <li><em>What is your current employment status?</em></li>
              <li><em>How many people live in your household, and what is their relationship to you?</em></li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong><u>Format and Structure Analysis </u></strong></p>
            <p>Overall, the questionnaire is clear and straightforward, using categorised sections to group similar
              questions effectively. However, its length may overwhelm some respondents, potentially affecting
              completion rates.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Question Analysis </u></strong></p>
            <p>While collecting respondents' dates of birth, provides valuable demographic data, this question may cause
              discomfort for individuals who prefer not to share their age. Additionally, the variation in date formats
              across countries could confuse respondents whose primary nationality is not English. To address these
              issues, I recommend requesting respondents' age range instead. This would provide the necessary data
              without causing confusion or discomfort.</p>
            <p>Although asking about sex is a reasonable question, the limited response options may exclude or offend
              individuals in the LGBTQIA+ community. A lack of inclusivity can lead to feelings of marginalisation. To
              avoid this, I suggest expanding the response options to include categories such as "Non-binary," "Prefer
              not to say", or an open-text option to reflect modern societal diversity.</p>
            <p>The question on ethnicity is important for collecting data on diversity. However, the response categories
              are often broad and may not adequately represent all ethnic groups. This lack of specificity could lead to
              confusion or frustration among respondents unsure of which category applies to them. Adding more granular
              options or an open-text field for "Other" would enhance inclusivity and accuracy.</p>
            <p>The question on long-term health conditions and disabilities is limited to "Yes" or "No" responses, as
              such it is overly simplistic. It misses the opportunity to gather detailed data about the nature of
              respondents' conditions or disabilities. A follow-up question allowing respondents to specify the type of
              condition would provide more meaningful insights.</p>
            <p>Whilst understanding employment status is essential for analysing labour market trends, the limited
              response options exclude less common forms of work, such as gig economy roles or unpaid caregiving. This
              question could be improved by offering a broader range of employment categories or an open-text
              option.</p>
            <p>The question about household composition requires respondents to categorise relationships into predefined
              roles, which may not reflect modern family dynamics. Adding an "Other" option or allowing respondents to
              specify relationships would accommodate diverse household arrangements.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
            <p>While the Census questionnaire is a valuable tool for collecting demographic and household data in
              England and Wales, several questions lack inclusivity and flexibility. Expanding response options to
              reflect modern societal diversity, including a section for participant feedback, and incorporating
              follow-up questions where necessary would enhance the quality and completeness of the data collected.</p>

            <h5>How the artefact relates to the module objectives</h5>
            <p>The Questionnaires Wiki Activity in Unit 5 of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module
              directly aligns with the module objectives by fostering collaborative learning, critical analysis of
              survey methodology, and practical application of research techniques. This activity enables students to
              explore the principles of questionnaire design, engage in peer knowledge-sharing, and refine their
              understanding of data collection strategies in research.</p>
            <p>One of the key module objectives is to appraise the principles of academic investigation and apply them
              to a research topic in the applicable computing field. The Questionnaires Wiki Activity facilitates this
              by encouraging students to research, design, and evaluate different types of questionnaires, considering
              factors such as question phrasing, response formats, sampling techniques, and ethical considerations. In
              computing research, questionnaires are widely used for usability testing, cybersecurity awareness
              assessments, and AI ethics studies. By participating in this collaborative activity, students gain
              insights into best practices for crafting effective survey instruments and develop a deeper appreciation
              of how data collection impacts research validity.</p>
            <p>This activity also supports the objective of evaluating critically existing literature, research design,
              and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes. Through collaborative discussions
              and contributions to the wiki platform, students analyse different questionnaire methodologies, explore
              common pitfalls such as bias, leading questions, and poor response design, and compare different
              approaches to survey administration (e.g., online surveys vs. face-to-face interviews). They critically
              examine real-world examples and case studies, identifying how questionnaire design influences research
              outcomes. This critical engagement strengthens their ability to assess the quality of research methods and
              apply best practices in their own projects.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the Questionnaires Wiki Activity aligns with the module objective of appraising the
              professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical issues that affect computing professionals. Ethical
              considerations are crucial in survey research, particularly in computing fields where data privacy and
              informed consent are paramount. Through the wiki discussions, students explore ethical issues related to
              data protection laws (e.g., GDPR), informed consent, respondent anonymity, and potential biases in
              question framing. This encourages them to apply ethical principles in designing surveys, ensuring
              fairness, transparency, and reliability in data collection.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the activity helps students develop skills necessary for producing and evaluating critically
              the resulting research proposal for their chosen topic. Since questionnaires are a common research tool in
              computing disciplines, understanding how to construct, test, and refine them is essential for ensuring
              accurate and meaningful data collection. By engaging in collaborative discussions and peer feedback,
              students gain a broader perspective on different questionnaire formats and their applicability to various
              research contexts. This knowledge directly informs their ability to justify methodological choices in
              their research proposals, ensuring robust and well-founded data collection methods.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the Questionnaires Wiki Activity promotes teamwork, knowledge-sharing, and interdisciplinary
              collaboration. A key aspect of academic and professional development is the ability to communicate
              research ideas effectively, engage with diverse perspectives, and integrate feedback to improve research
              quality. By contributing to a shared knowledge base, students enhance their ability to constructively
              critique and refine research methodologies, which is a valuable skill in both academia and industry.</p>
            <p>The Questionnaires Wiki Activity supports the Research Methods and Professional Practice module
              objectives by enhancing students&rsquo; understanding of survey design, ethical research practices, and
              methodological evaluation. It encourages collaborative learning, critical thinking, and application of
              research principles in computing contexts. Through this activity, students develop the necessary skills to
              design, analyse, and refine questionnaires for academic and professional research, ensuring valid,
              ethical, and high-quality data collection practices.</p>

          <h5 id="reflection">Reflection</h5>
          <p><strong><u>Description</u></strong></p>
          <p>This was the fifth unit of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module. The goals of this unit
            were to understand the role of interviews and surveys in research and determine their relevance to your
            study, to be able to differentiate between surveys and questionnaires and understand their unique purposes,
            to learn how to design effective questionnaires to collect qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-method data,
            to explore pre- and post-testing methods and their application in research and to be able to analyse data
            collected through interviews, surveys, and questionnaires effectively.</p>
          <p>For this unit we were required to read an extract from chapter two in the book &lsquo;Projects in Computing
            and Information Systems: A Student's Guide&rsquo; (Dawson, 2015), a paper on qualitative research (Hoepfl,
            1997), a guide on using NVivo (Allsop et al., 2022) and an article on analysing qualitative data (Learning
            for Action, 2014). In addition to the required reading, there was a lecture cast on questionnaire
            design.</p>
          <p>There were two formative activities for this unit. The first formative activity was to reflect on the
            Cambridge Analytica scandal and provide two high profile examples of inappropriate use of surveys focusing
            on the social, legal and ethical concerns. The second formative activity was to critique a questionnaire. In
            addition to the two formative activities, we were asked to think about the data collection tool we intend to
            use in the module and in the dissertation module.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Feelings</u></strong></p>
          <p>When I was accessing the learning platform, I noticed one of the references in the lecture casts pointed to
            a broken link, there were some minor grammatical errors on the learning platform and not all the references
            in the reading list were correct (the references for the articles on Analysing Qualitative Data and
            comparing Surveys and questionnaires were both listed without a date when the publication date can be found
            in the source code). I would have expected the learning platform to be checked regularly to avoid these
            issues.</p>
          <p>When I was doing the required reading for this module, I felt as though it didn't seem entirely relevant as
            we are not expected to use NVivo in this module and the other articles were rather dated.</p>
          <p>The workload for this unit was much more manageable compared to the previous units in the module up to this
            point, as such, it allowed me to spend more time catching up with the module whilst I continued working on
            PHD
            applications.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Evaluation</u></strong></p>
          <p>The aspects of the unit that I feel went well were; all goals were achieved, my academic writing
            skills improved as a result of the formative activities, and the workload was a lot more manageable with my
            other commitments.</p>
          <p>The main area where I could have improved during this unit of the module was with my time management as I
            spent a lot of time working on the formative activities this week, so I didn&rsquo;t have as much time as I
            would have liked to spend catching up with the e-portfolio.</p>
          <p>The only other negative I really had for this unit of the module was with the inconsistencies on the
            learning platform. With the referencing format changing in 2025 but still accepting the current format for
            the next year, this will most likely cause a great deal of confusion as there are multiple ways of
            referencing. In addition, the referencing on the learning platform not matching up with the current
            guidelines provided by the university raises even more potential questions on how to reference
            correctly.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Analysis</u></strong></p>
          <p>Reflecting on this unit, I recognise the overlap between the unit goals and my academic and
            professional aspirations, as I begin preparation for PHD research. This unit provided insights into the
            differences between surveys and questionnaires and their respective purposes, along with guidance on
            designing effective data collection tools. The introduction of pre- and post-testing methods was especially
            beneficial, offering strategies to enhance the validity and reliability of research data. These skills are
            directly relevant to conducting primary research, which is a significant component of my future academic
            endeavours.</p>
          <p>Despite these strengths, the learning experience was hindered by inconsistencies on the learning platform.
            Broken links, outdated references, and discrepancies in referencing formats required additional time and
            effort to address, which could have been spent on more meaningful engagement with the material. On a
            positive note, the workload for this unit was more manageable than in previous weeks, allowing me to focus
            on other responsibilities, including my PHD applications. However, my time management could have been
            better, as I spent a significant amount of time on the formative activities, leaving not enough time to
            update my e-portfolio and fully consolidate my learning.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
          <p>Overall, the unit successfully achieved its goals and provided a solid foundation for conducting and
            evaluating research. It reinforced my academic writing and critical thinking skills, which are crucial for
            my PHD journey. However, my experience highlighted areas for improvement, such as the need for consistent
            and accurate learning materials and better personal time management. Despite these challenges, I feel more
            confident in my ability to design and critique research tools, which will serve me well in future research
            projects. This unit has been instrumental in bridging the gap between my current capabilities and the
            demands of a PHD.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Action Plan</u></strong></p>
          <p>Moving forward, I plan to focus on improving my time management skills to better balance module
            requirements with other responsibilities. To achieve this, I will allocate specific time slots for different
            tasks using a digital planner to visualise deadlines and prioritise effectively.</p>
          <p>In terms of skill development, I aim to practice designing and critiquing research tools, such as surveys
            and questionnaires, beyond the scope of this module. Even though NVivo was not required for this unit, I
            plan to explore it further as familiarity with qualitative analysis software will be invaluable for my PHD
            research and dissertation. To enhance my academic writing, I will continue engaging in formative activities
            and seek feedback from peers or use tools like Grammarly to refine my work further. Lastly, I will integrate
            the skills learned in this unit into my ongoing PhD applications, emphasising my ability to conduct ethical
            and effective research, while also exploring advanced research techniques to gain a competitive edge.</p>

          <h5>How the artefact relates to the module objectives</h5>
          <p>The Unit 5 Reflection in the Research Methods and Professional Practice module directly aligns with the
            module objectives by allowing students to critically assess their learning experiences, research skills, and
            ethical considerations related to survey methods, interviews, and questionnaire design. This reflective
            practice fosters self-awareness, critical thinking, and the application of research methodologies, which are
            essential parts of the module&rsquo;s intended learning outcomes.</p>
          <p>One of the key module objectives is to appraise the principles of academic investigation and apply them to
            a research topic in the applicable computing field. Unit 5 focused on survey methods, questionnaire design,
            and interviews, all of which are fundamental data collection techniques in computing research. Through
            reflection, students critically analyse their experiences with designing and evaluating surveys, identifying
            challenges, biases, and areas for improvement in their approach. By considering real-world applications,
            such as user experience studies, cybersecurity awareness surveys, and AI ethics research, students apply
            theoretical knowledge to practical computing contexts.</p>
          <p>The reflection also supports the objective of evaluating critically existing literature, research design,
            and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes. By reflecting on their engagement
            with academic readings, case studies, and collaborative discussions, students assess how different survey
            and interview techniques contribute to effective data collection. They explore the reliability, validity,
            and ethical considerations associated with qualitative and quantitative research methods, enhancing their
            ability to critically evaluate existing research and apply best practices in their own studies.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the Unit 5 Reflection aligns with the module objective of appraising the professional, legal,
            social, cultural, and ethical issues that affect computing professionals. Ethical considerations in survey
            research and interviews&mdash;such as informed consent, participant privacy, data security, and bias in
            question formulation&mdash;are crucial topics in computing. By reflecting on these issues, students develop
            a deeper understanding of how ethical guidelines (e.g., GDPR, ACM Code of Ethics) influence data collection
            and analysis. This awareness ensures that students are prepared to conduct ethically responsible research
            that adheres to industry standards and best practices.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the reflection supports the objective of producing and evaluating critically the resulting
            research proposal for the chosen topic. Understanding how to structure and conduct interviews, design
            effective questionnaires, and analyse survey data is crucial when formulating a research proposal. By
            reflecting on their experiences with survey methodologies, data collection challenges, and ethical dilemmas,
            students refine their ability to justify methodological choices in their proposals. This reflection
            contributes to their academic and professional development, ensuring that they design research projects with
            strong methodological foundations.</p>
          <p>The Unit 5 Reflection helps students consolidate their learning by critically analysing their engagement
            with survey methods, interviews, and questionnaire design. By linking these experiences to academic
            principles, ethical considerations, and research methodologies, students develop a comprehensive
            understanding of data collection techniques in computing research. This reflective practice strengthens
            their ability to apply research methods effectively, justify methodological decisions, and uphold ethical
            standards in academic and professional settings, aligning with the overarching module objectives.</p>
