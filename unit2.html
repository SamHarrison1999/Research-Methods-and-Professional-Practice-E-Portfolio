            <!-- e-Portfolio Activity: Literature Review Outline -->
            <h5 id="reflectiveActivity">Literature Review Plan</h5>
            <p>Research Topic: AI-based assistive technology for the physically disabled and/or the elderly</p>
            <p><strong><u>What is the focus and aim of your review? Who is your audience?</u></strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>How can assistive technology improve a disabled persons quality of life?</li>
              <li>What are the benefits of AI based assistive technology?</li>
              <li>What are the ethical, legal and social concerns relevant to assistive technology, more specifically AI
                based assistive technology?
              </li>
              <li>What are the drawbacks to assistive technology? (cost, negative perception etc.)</li>
              <li>The target audience is the disabled, the elderly and their carers
                <ul>
                  <li>The goal is to educate them on the assistive technologies available to them</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong><u>Why is there a need for your review? Why is it significant?</u></strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Because some people with disabilities may not be aware of the assistive technologies available to them
                <ul>
                  <li>Possible reasons for this; they were diagnosed later in life so may not have been aware of their
                    disabilities, they were unaware of the assistive technologies, they may have server mental
                    deficiencies so may be unable to understand the information that has been provided to them on
                    assistive technologies in the past
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Assistive technologies could help to safeguard the vulnerable
              </li>
              <li>Assistive technologies could improve the quality of life for people with severe disabilities</li>
              <li>Assistive technologies can help people who struggle with daily activities of life and may allow them
                to become more independent
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong><u>What is the context of the topic or issue? What perspective do you take? What framework do you
              use to synthesise the literature?</u></strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The context of the topic is going to be centred around how assistive technologies can improve
                vulnerable people&rsquo;s quality of life allowing them to be more independent
              </li>
              <li>While I will mainly be looking at the perspective of how assistive technology has improved their life,
                I will also touch on the drawbacks of assistive technology such as the over reliance on it.
              </li>
              <li>I will be using Chris Hart&rsquo;s book on Literature Reviews (Hart, 2018) in conjunction with Harris
                Cooper&rsquo;s article on Literature Reviews (Cooper, 1988) for guidance when writing the literature
                review
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong><u>How did you locate and select sources for inclusion in the review?</u></strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sources were located a series of key word search on Google Scholar and Google. I also discussed
                assistive technologies with my DSA mentor as due to their experience working with people with
                disabilities; they were more aware of the types of assistive technologies available in the market today.
              </li>
              <li>Documents that weren&rsquo;t written or translated into English were excluded as that is the only
                language I can understand.
              </li>
              <li>Documents that didn&rsquo;t come from reputable sources were excluded as they haven&rsquo;t been
                checked for accuracy
              </li>
              <li>It was important to find academic articles that argued both for and against the use of AI assistive
                technologies

            <p><strong><u>What are the main findings in the literature on this topic?</u></strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Assistive technologies help people with disabilities and the elderly regain their own independence
                improving their overall quality of life and self-confidence
              </li>
              <li>Assistive technologies have use cases across all aspects of everyday life</li>
              <li>Even though there are tons of benefits to assistive technology, particularly for the disabled and
                elderly, there are some potential concerns to the technology such as over reliance on the technology and
                privacy concerns
              </li>
              <li>In less economically developed countries, the elderly and disabled don&rsquo;t have the access to
                assistive technologies
              </li>
              <li>Due to the cost, those who have a genuine need for assistive technology may not have access to the
                technology
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong><u>What are the main strengths and limitations of this literature? Are there any discrepancies in
              this literature?</u></strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Every disabled person&rsquo;s disability will affect them differently</li>
              <li>Most of the literature is from the last decade</li>
              <li>Data was limited as excluded non-English sources
                <ul>
                  <li>Different cultures view disabilities differently</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>All sources were academic sources
                <ul>
                  <li>No first-hand research</li>
                  <li>Those who have first-hand experience will have different viewpoints compared to those who are

            <h5>How the artefact relates to the module objectives</h5>
            <p>The Literature Review Plan is closely related to the module objectives, as it plays a crucial role in the
              research process by ensuring a structured and critical approach to reviewing existing academic work. This
              artefact directly supports the goal of appraising professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical
              issues affecting computing professionals, as conducting a literature review requires an awareness of
              ethical considerations, including proper citation, avoiding plagiarism, and evaluating sources for
              credibility. By planning the literature review, students ensure that they critically assess research
              studies that address key ethical challenges in computing, such as data privacy, bias in artificial
              intelligence, and cybersecurity concerns.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the Literature Review Plan aligns with the objective of appraising the principles of
              academic investigation, as it requires students to structure their research in a way that supports
              systematic inquiry. Academic research is built upon previous findings, and a well-developed literature
              review ensures that students engage with relevant theories, frameworks, and methodologies. By planning how
              to collect, evaluate, and synthesise sources, students learn to apply academic research principles
              effectively, ensuring their work is well-grounded in existing knowledge.</p>
            <p>This artefact also supports the critical evaluation of existing literature, research design, and
              methodology. The literature review process involves analysing past studies to identify research gaps,
              assess the strengths and weaknesses of different methodologies, and determine the most relevant approaches
              for a given topic. By planning their literature review, students develop skills in comparing and
              contrasting different studies, evaluating the reliability of research findings, and selecting the most
              appropriate frameworks for their own investigation. This critical evaluation is essential for developing a
              strong research foundation and making informed methodological choices.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the Literature Review Plan is integral to producing and critically evaluating a research
              proposal. A well-structured literature review provides the theoretical background for a research proposal,
              justifying the significance of the research problem and establishing the rationale for the chosen
              methodology. By outlining how key studies relate to their research question, students ensure that their
              proposal is grounded in existing knowledge and that their investigation will contribute meaningfully to
              the field. The ability to review and critique literature is crucial in demonstrating academic rigour and
              ensuring that research proposals are logically structured and methodologically sound.</p>
            <p>Overall, the Literature Review Plan is a foundational artefact that helps students develop key research
              competencies while aligning with the module objectives. It reinforces ethical research practices, promotes
              critical engagement with academic literature, and supports the development of a robust research proposal
              by ensuring that students have a comprehensive understanding of their chosen topic.</p>
            <!-- e-Portfolio Activity: Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 -->
            <h5>Collaborative Discussion Peer Responses</h5>
            <h6>How the artefacts relate to the module objectives</h6>
            <p>The peer responses to the first collaborative discussion align with the module objectives by fostering
              critical engagement with professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical issues in computing. Through
              discussion and peer feedback, students analyse diverse perspectives on key topics such as data privacy,
              cybersecurity ethics, and the impact of artificial intelligence on society. This engagement directly
              supports the objective of appraising the professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical issues that
              affect computing professionals, as students must evaluate ethical dilemmas, apply relevant frameworks, and
              justify their viewpoints with academic evidence. The process of responding to peers also encourages
              respectful debate and ethical reasoning, which are essential skills for professional practice.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the peer responses contribute to the appraisal of academic investigation principles by
              encouraging students to reflect on how research questions are formulated and answered within the computing
              field. By engaging in discussions and providing feedback, students refine their ability to critically
              assess arguments, identify research gaps, and recognise the importance of evidence-based reasoning. This
              process also enhances their understanding of how academic discourse is structured, helping them develop
              stronger research skills for their own projects.</p>
            <p>The activity also relates to evaluating existing literature, research design, and methodology since
              students often incorporate academic sources to support their arguments and critique those presented by
              their peers. In responding to others, they assess the credibility and relevance of research findings,
              compare different viewpoints, and refine their own positions based on new insights. This practice of
              critical engagement and literature evaluation is essential for conducting independent research and
              producing well-founded academic work.</p>
            <p>Finally, the peer responses play a role in the development and critical evaluation of research proposals
              by reinforcing the importance of structured argumentation and evidence-based reasoning. Engaging in peer
              discussions allows students to refine their research focus, consider alternative perspectives, and
              integrate feedback to strengthen their proposals. Constructive critique from peers helps identify
              potential weaknesses in arguments and encourages continuous improvement in research planning and
              methodology selection.</p>
            <p>Overall, the peer responses to the first collaborative discussion contribute significantly to the module
              objectives by promoting ethical awareness, strengthening research and critical thinking skills, and
              encouraging active engagement with academic literature and methodologies. Through this process, students
              develop essential competencies in academic discourse, research evaluation, and professional
              communication.</p>
            <h5 id="collaborativeDiscussionPeerResponseOne">Collaborative Discussion 1 - Peer Response 1</h5>
            <p>Dear Thomas,</p>
            <p>The fact you gave a brief explanation as to why you chose the malware disruption case study made your
              post stand out more as you didn&rsquo;t go straight into the ethical, legal and social issues like many of
              the other students.</p>
            <p>Providing a background on the ethical concerns the hackers who provided the worm that forcibly took Rouge
              Services offline in relation to the BCS code of conduct showed that you are capable of taking a step back
              and looking at the bigger picture as you provided a perspective from everyone involved, not just Rogue
              services.</p>
            <p>While referencing the computer misuse act, demonstrated a good understanding of cyber laws it is only
              applicable to organisations based in the United Kingdom. In the case study, it mentioned that the reason
              governmental agencies had such an issue shutting Rouge Services down was because in the region they
              operated, the laws were not strong enough to force Rouge services cooperation. I was wondering if you have
              looked into the steps taken by other governments to combat cybercrime as some less economically developed
              countries have very lax regulations regarding cyber laws. Have you looked into cyber laws in other
              countries such as China&rsquo;s Cybersecurity law (The Cybersecurity Law of the People's Republic of
              China, 2017).</p>
            <p>While you used paragraphs to separate the information, you didn't make use of any section headers. I
              would
              strongly recommend using section headers in any academic writing to make the document easier to read.</p>
            <p>I noticed a minor inconsistency in your references when I compared them against the example guidelines
              provided by the university as you used a letter after the year to distinguish between multiple works by
              the same author published in the same year, whereas in the example documents on referencing provided by
              the
              university, they do not follow this convention.</p>
            <p>After noticing the minor inconsistencies in your references, I looked further into your references and
              noticed the year on the ACM code of ethics reference and the year on the malware disruption use case were
              incorrect as if you look at the meta tags on the malware disruption use case the publication date was the
              27<sup>th </sup>of July 2018 and if you look at the date listed in the copyright notice for the ACM code
              of ethics, it was also published in 2018, but you put 2024 for both. Additionally, I noticed your inline
              references were not always correct. For example, the inline reference for the computer misuse act was
              incorrect as you are supposed to list the law and the year it was made, not the government who made it. I
              would suggest that when writing your references in the future, double-check them before any submissions to
              ensure they are correct and follow the guidelines provided by the university.</p>
            <p>When you referenced section 4a of the BCS code of conduct, you only mentioned that they are breaking that
              particular section of the BCS code of conduct I would have expected you to explain why you considered
              their
              actions to be a breach of the BCS code of conduct, E.G. how could their actions bring the profession into
              disrepute? At postgraduate level, you are expected to dig deeper looking at why not just what.</p>
            <p>I believe your post could have benefited from you providing your own experience on ethics, E.G. Has there
              ever been any time you had to make a decision where you had ethical concerns if so, what were your
              concerns? What decision did you make? Who did you consult with before making your decision?</p>
            <p>Finally, I felt your final paragraph was used effectively to summarise your overall thoughts on the
              legal, social and ethics issues relevant to IT.</p>
            <p>Best Regards,</p>
            <p>Sam</p>

            <p>Dear Sudesh,</p>
            <p>I liked that you selected a different case study to most of the other students, as if everyone
              chose the same case study, all the posts may be too similar to provide any real value.</p>
            <p>You provided a good explanation as to what Dark UX Patterns are and why they are a problem.</p>
            <p>Referencing the Ombudsman process and the Federal Trade Commission demonstrated a good understanding of
              the legal issue related to dark UX Patterns. Have you looked into the punishment for companies who have
              violated these laws? For example, in 2023, Epic games were fined $245 million for using dark patterns to
              trick players into making unwanted purchases and were ordered to stop charging consumers without their
              consent and to stop blocking consumers from accessing their accounts for breaking section 5 of the Federal
              Trade Commission (FTC, 2023).</p>
            <p>You were able to provide a unique perspective on the legal issues due to not being from the United
              Kingdom
              like most of the other students on the module.</p>
            <p>There were several mistakes in your references, for example, all of your inline references were incorrect
              as you should have used a comma instead of a full stop, I would suggest taking a look at the University&rsquo;s
              referencing guide to ensure you correctly reference your work in the future.</p>
            <p>There were several grammatical mistakes throughout your post, for example, you didn&rsquo;t surround any
              quotes with quotation marks, and there shouldn't be a space before the first question mark in the second
              paragraph. I would suggest proofreading your work in the future and using a tool like Grammarly to avoid
              these types of grammatical errors.</p>
            <p>You seem to have misinterpreted the question being asked as you were supposed to have referenced the
              legal, social and ethical issues of Dark UX patterns in relation to the BCS Code of Conduct (BCS, 2022)
              and ACM&rsquo;s Code of Ethics (ACM, 2021). Additionally, I noticed the BCS Code of Conduct (BCS, 2022)
              and the Dark UX Patterns case study (ACM, 2018) have not been referenced at all. I would suggest in the
              future that you spend additional time reading the question to avoid any misunderstandings.</p>
            <p>Finally, the structure of your post could have been improved as you haven't used any section headers for
              readability and the quote is &ldquo;the customer is always right&rdquo; not &ldquo;the client is right&rdquo;.
              It is of the utmost importance that when quoting someone in that, the quote is correct.</p>

            <p>Dear Gareth,</p>
            <p>I liked that you selected a different case study to most of the other students, as if everyone
              chose the same case study, all the posts may be too similar. Additionally, I like that you provided
              background on the case study as it made easier to understand. Overall, I found your post to be
              well-structured as you made good use of paragraphs and headings to improve readability.</p>
            <p>Referencing the emotional and physical harm caused by the steps Q industries took to deter vandalism
              demonstrated a good understanding of the effect Q industries actions could have on individuals.
              Referencing how it would impact those with respiratory issues showed a good understanding of the medical
              issues that should have also been considered by Q industries.</p>
            <p>You referenced the ethical concerns in relation to the use of non-lethal and lethal force as a deterrent
              to vandalism citing specific sections of both the BCS Code of Conduct (BCS, 20220 and ACM&rsquo;s Code of
              Ethics and Professional Conduct (ACM, 2021) to good effect</p>
            <p>There was a minor grammatical error in the introductory sentence where you should have used future tense.
              It should have been along the lines of, I will be analysing the legal, social and ethical implications
              relevant to Automated Active Response Weaponry (ACM, 2018) in relation to ACM&rsquo;s Code of Ethics and
              Professional Conduct (ACM, 2021) and the BCS Code of Conduct (BCS, 2022).</p>
            <p>There were no inline references used throughout your post, and the reference list was incomplete as you
              are
              supposed to include a link to the references and the date they were accessed. Additionally, when looking
              into your references, I noticed the year on the case study reference is incorrect as the case study was
              published in 2018 which can be found in the metadata on the webpage. When writing references in the
              future,
              I would strongly suggest you refer back to the referencing guide provided by the university and that you
              double-check your references prior to submitting any work as a portion of your final grade is made up from
              correctly referencing your work, and the lecturer (Dr Outram) throughout this module has stressed the
              importance of referencing appropriately.</p>
            <p>You seem to have misinterpreted the question being asked as you only mentioned the ethical issues
              when the task was also to mention the social and legal issues. I would suggest rereading the
              question prior to your summary post.</p>
            <p>For the ethical concerns, you only mentioned Q industries response to protesters. Did you consider the
              wider ethical issues of the technology or the legal issues such as the laws surrounding export controls of
              dual use technology (Export Control Act, 2002) or the legal ramifications if the technology inadvertently
              killed someone with an underlying health condition?</p>
            <p>Best Regards,</p>

          <!-- Reflection Section -->
          <h5 id="reflection">Reflection</h5>
          <p><strong><u>Description</u></strong></p>
          <p>This unit was the second unit of the Research Methods and Professional Practices module. The goals of this
            unit were to learn how to write a research question, literature review and research proposal.</p>
          <p>For this unit, we were required to read the majority of the first five chapters of the book Projects in
            Computing and Information Systems: A Students guide (Dawson, 2015), chapter 14 from the book Writing about
            Learning and Teaching in Higher Education (Healey et al., 2020) and the article on writing a literature
            review from an Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of California (Boza, 2022).</p>
          <p>The formative activity for this unit was to respond to at least 3 of your peers&rsquo; collaborative
            discussion posts on the legal, social and ethical issues of one of the ACM case studies (ACM, 2018). The
            E-Portfolio activity for this unit was to begin planning your literature review using the literature review
            guide questions provided.</p>
          <p>The lecture cast for this unit focused on how to plan a research question, how to plan a research proposal
            and the literature review process.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Feelings</u></strong></p>
          <p>I didn&rsquo;t see the point of having to respond to three of my peers&rsquo; collaborative discussion
            posts as opposed to the two required in previous modules as the extra time spent researching, planning and
            writing could have been better spent working on the upcoming assignment.</p>
          <p>I was already a week behind due to having to work on the portfolio assignment for a previous module, so the
            work load for this week was higher as I had to try to catch up with the module, which was not ideal.
            Additionally, I had a couple of job interviews this week, so it was a very hectic week with lots going
            on.</p>
          <p>When I was reading through the learning platform, I noticed some errors related to references. I was
            surprised to see this as Dr Outram stressed the importance of having correct references only to have
            mistakes in the references they used. This could cause confusion for students as the references aren&rsquo;t
            following the reference guide provided by the university.</p>
          <p>I found the work load for this unit to be a lot more manageable than the previous unit as there were a lot
            fewer formative activities. As I am managing job applications, doctorate applications and my masters, I need
            to manage my time effectively, which I believe I was able to do in this unit a lot better than the previous
            unit.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Evaluation</u></strong></p>
          <p>The main positives of this unit were after completing the unit, I learnt how to write an effective
            literature review and I improved my research skills. These skills will need to be developed further for my
            dissertation and my doctorate applications.</p>
          <p>Due to the heavy workload of the previous unit and my other commitments, I was still trying to catch up
            with
            the module when doing this module, so I didn't have as much time to spend as I would have liked on the
            formatives for this unit.</p>
          <p>The main negative I noticed during this unit was that the participation of the other students in the
            collaborative discussion was not up to the standard I would have expected from postgraduate students. This
            has been a common trend throughout my masters where collaborative discussion posts have always got few
            responses. Dr Outram did attempt to get more participation in the collaborative discussions by using the
            module announcements to remind students that the collaborative discussions are part of the portfolio but
            that didn&rsquo;t seem to make any difference. On the one module where the collaborative discussions were
            used effectively, Dr Peoples also provided feedback to the students, so maybe Dr Outram could do that in the
            future to ensure more active student participation.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Analysis</u></strong></p>
          <p>The workload of this module to date has forced me to try to improve my time management skills as I have a
            lot of other commitments that I have to manage alongside my masters.</p>
          <p>As I am planning on applying for PHD&rsquo;s and still have a dissertation to do learning how to write a
            research proposal is a skill I will need.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
          <p>Over the course of the unit, I learnt a lot about writing research proposals and literature reviews. As I
            am planning on doing a PHD and am actively thinking about working in research, knowing as much about
            research
            is key.</p>
          <p>For the literature review assignment, I chose AI-based assistive technology for the disabled after
            researching both the machine learning tools used in predicting sports results and the AI-based assistive
            technology for the disabled. The main reason for my decision was due to the amount of available research
            available as the machine learning tools used in predicting sports results is very niche compared to
            assistive technologies for people with disabilities.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Action plan</u></strong></p>
          <p>If I was to redo this unit of the module, I would have made sure not to fall behind at the beginning of the
            module as to I had to spend a lot of time trying to catch up with the module. As the lecturer advised us to
            try to stay up to date with the module due to the increasing workload each week being one week behind now
            could result in me needing to use the one-week extension I am entitled to as part of my reasonable
            adjustment plan.</p>

          <h6>How the reflection relates to the module objectives</h6>
          <p>The Unit 2 reflection relates to the module objectives by allowing for critical self-assessment of key
            research skills, particularly in formulating research questions, conducting literature reviews, and
            developing research proposals. This reflection directly supports the objective of appraising the principles
            of academic investigation and applying them to a research topic in the applicable computing field, as it
            encourages students to evaluate how they approach defining and refining research questions. By reflecting on
            the challenges faced in crafting a well-structured research proposal, students gain a deeper understanding
            of the research process and its significance in computing disciplines.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the reflection ties into the evaluation of existing literature, research design, and
            methodology by prompting students to assess their experiences with literature review strategies. A key
            aspect of Unit 2 was developing skills in locating, critiquing, and synthesising scholarly sources to
            support a research proposal. The reflection allows students to consider how effectively they applied these
            techniques, identify areas for improvement, and refine their ability to analyse and interpret academic
            literature. This process aligns with the module&rsquo;s emphasis on critical engagement with research
            methodologies and data analysis processes.</p>
          <p>The ethical, legal, and professional considerations in research are also addressed within the reflection,
            connecting to the objective of appraising professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical issues that
            affect computing professionals. Unit 2 emphasised the ethical responsibilities of researchers, particularly
            in ensuring academic integrity, avoiding bias in research question formulation, and adhering to ethical
            guidelines in data collection and literature review. Reflecting on these aspects helps students recognise
            the broader implications of research in computing and develop a responsible approach to academic
            investigation.</p>
          <p>Finally, the Unit 2 reflection supports the development and evaluation of a research proposal, as it allows
            students to critically assess their initial proposal drafts and consider how they can refine their approach
            based on feedback. By reflecting on the structure, clarity, and feasibility of their research proposals,
            students improve their ability to justify methodological choices and ensure their research is well-grounded
            in academic literature. This self-evaluation is crucial for developing a strong, evidence-based research
            proposal that aligns with academic and professional standards.</p>
          <p>Overall, the Unit 2 reflection contributes to the module objectives by enhancing students' understanding of
            academic research principles, strengthening their ability to evaluate literature and research methodologies,
            promoting ethical awareness, and refining their approach to developing well-structured research
            proposals.</p>
