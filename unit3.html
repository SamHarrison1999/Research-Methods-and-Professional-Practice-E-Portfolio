            <h5>How the artefact relates to the module objectives</h5>
            <p>The Research Proposal Review Activity on the Unit 3 page of the e-Portfolio aligns closely with the
              module objectives by fostering critical evaluation, research methodology assessment, and professional
              reflection, all of which are fundamental to academic and professional practice in computing.</p>
            <p>One of the key module objectives is to evaluate critically existing literature, research design, and
              methodology for a chosen topic, including data analysis processes. This activity directly contributes to
              this objective by requiring students to assess and critique research proposals, considering aspects such
              as the clarity of research questions, the appropriateness of selected methodologies, and the validity of
              data analysis techniques. Engaging in peer review and structured evaluation enhances students' ability to
              recognise strengths and weaknesses in research design, ensuring they can apply these insights to their own
              work.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the activity supports the objective of appraising the principles of academic investigation
              and applying them to a research topic in computing. By analysing different research proposals, students
              develop a deeper understanding of how to construct well-founded research questions, justify methodological
              choices, and address potential limitations. This process reinforces the importance of academic rigour,
              logical structuring, and methodological soundness in research.</p>
            <p>From an ethical and professional perspective, the activity also aligns with the objective to appraise
              professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical issues that affect computing professionals. Research
              proposals often involve considerations such as data privacy, ethical treatment of participants, and
              responsible data handling. By critically reviewing proposals, students assess how well these ethical
              concerns are addressed, preparing them to uphold ethical standards in their own research projects.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the Research Proposal Review Activity contributes to the final module objective of producing and
              critically evaluating a research proposal for a chosen topic. Reviewing multiple proposals exposes
              students to diverse research approaches, helping them refine their own proposals by incorporating best
              practices and avoiding common pitfalls. The feedback and insights gained from this exercise inform
              students&rsquo; ability to develop robust research proposals that meet academic and professional
              standards.</p>
            <p>In summary, this activity strengthens students' ability to evaluate research critically, apply academic
              investigation principles, assess ethical considerations, and refine their own research proposals, making
              it an essential part of their learning journey in the Research Methods and Professional Practice
              module.</p>
            <!-- e-Portfolio Activity: Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 -->
            <h5 id="collaborativeDiscussionSummaryPost">Collaborative Discussion 1 Summary Post</h5>
            <p><strong><u>Introduction </u></strong></p>
            <p>After reading through and contributing to the collaborative discussion posts from the other students and
              receiving feedback from Mario and Thomas on my initial post, I have learnt a lot about the importance of
              ethics in IT and the role it plays to ensure there has been no wrongdoing. I believe gaining insights from
              my peers is invaluable as they have a lot more experience than me and were able to provide insights that I
              had not previously considered.</p>
            <p>In my initial post, I explored the ethical, legal and social implications of the Malware Disruption case
              study provided by ACM (ACM, 2018). The case study looked at the mistakes made by Rouge Services and how
              they were complicit with Cyber-criminals using their web hosting services to perform malware attacks. Due
              to the laws surrounding malware varying from country to country, having a global consensus on the ethical
              considerations helps to ensure some form of consistency even if there are not legally binding.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Mario&rsquo;s Response</u></strong></p>
            <p>Mario suggested that I referenced how the ACM Code of Ethics (ACM, 2021) and the BCS Code of Conduct
              (BCS, 2022) are aligned as there is a lot of overlap between the two. When reading the posts of the other
              students, I noticed that some of the other students pointed how the specific sections of the ACM Code of
              Ethics are related to the BCS Code of Conduct. I thought this explanation added a lot of value to their
              post as it showed how while the ethical guidelines vary between organisations, the general principles are
              still the same. I agree with Mario that this explanation would have improved the quality of my initial
              post.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Thomas&rsquo;s Response</u></strong></p>
            <p>Thomas suggested that I considered the ethical implications of all those involved in the case study not
              just Rouge services. The reason I didn&rsquo;t do this in my initial post was due to the suggested word
              count. Even though I believe my reasoning for not adding this was valid, I agree with Thomas that my post
              could have benefited from the ethical concerns for those who built the worm that forcibly took Rouge
              Services offline as it would have demonstrated my ability to look at the bigger picture by considering the
              legal, ethical and social concerns for everyone involved. For example, while the intentions of the worm
              were to prevent any further harm, ultimately the worm caused harm to Rouges Services more legitimate
              clients, thereby breaking ethical principles related to unintentional harm and destruction of data even
              though they had good intentions. To quote Kristin Hannah, a number one New York Times bestselling author
              &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not intentions that matter, It&rsquo;s actions&rdquo;.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
            <p>While the ethical guidelines provided by ACM (ACM, 2021) and BCS (BCS, 2022) are good idea in theory as
              they are a useful tool in educating people on what it means to be ethical, the usefulness of them can be
              brought into question as they are not enforceable as they are merely guidelines and not laws as such
              individuals and organisations can choose to ignore them.</p>

            <h5>How the artefact relates to the module objectives</h5>
            <p>The Collaborative Discussion Summary Post in Unit 3 of the e-Portfolio is a critical component that
              aligns well with the module objectives by emphasising critical thinking, research evaluation, and
              professional engagement&mdash;all key skills in the Research Methods and Professional Practice module.</p>
            <p>One of the core objectives of the module is to appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural, and
              ethical issues that affect computing professionals. The summary post consolidates the insights gained from
              peer discussions, enabling students to reflect on diverse perspectives and ethical considerations
              presented during the collaboration. This activity fosters an appreciation for how different viewpoints and
              approaches impact the application of research in real-world contexts, particularly within the computing
              field. By synthesising various ideas, students are encouraged to consider the broader implications of
              their research and professional decisions, aligning directly with the goal of ethical and socially
              responsible practice.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the activity addresses the module objective to evaluate critically existing literature,
              research design, and methodology for a chosen topic, including data analysis processes. Through discussion
              and summarisation, students engage deeply with research topics, identifying key themes, methodologies, and
              gaps in the literature. The summary post helps students consolidate their understanding of effective
              research design, data analysis strategies, and the critical evaluation of sources. It enhances their
              ability to recognise the strengths and limitations of different research approaches, a skill that is
              crucial when assessing their own and others&rsquo; work.</p>
            <p>The Collaborative Discussion Summary Post also supports the objective of appraising the principles of
              academic investigation and applying them to a research topic in the applicable computing field. This
              activity requires students to integrate and reflect on feedback received from their peers, encouraging
              them to refine their research approach based on constructive critique. By summarising the main points of
              discussion, students demonstrate their ability to extract relevant information, connect theoretical
              concepts to practical applications, and apply academic investigation principles to computing-related
              issues.</p>
            <p>Finally, the summary post contributes to the objective of producing and critically evaluating a research
              proposal for a chosen topic. The insights gained from discussions with peers provide valuable feedback
              that can be integrated into the research proposal development process. It encourages students to think
              critically about their research questions, methodologies, and the overall design of their projects. By
              reflecting on the collaborative discussions, students can identify areas for improvement in their
              proposals, ultimately leading to a more robust and well-structured research plan.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the Collaborative Discussion Summary Post is integral to achieving the module objectives
              by reinforcing students&rsquo; abilities to critically evaluate research, engage with ethical and
              professional issues, apply academic investigation principles, and refine their research proposals. It
              provides an opportunity for deeper reflection and synthesis of ideas, enhancing their overall learning
              experience and preparing them for future challenges in the field of computing.</p>

          <p>The article in AI Magazine analyses past AI research projects to guide future research. It combines a
            theoretical analysis with a reflection on the methods AI researchers use to address specific problems and
            proposes improvements to AI research methodologies through a meta-analysis. As the findings are theoretical,
            one could question the real-world value.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Artificial Intelligence Research: A Review on Dominant Themes, Methods, Frameworks, and Future
            Research Directions</u></strong></p>
          <p>The article from CIAT is a comprehensive literature review and thematic analysis of 85 peer reviewed
            articles on AI research themes and methodologies between 2020 and 2023. The article looks at emerging trends
            in technology and security issues with AI with the goal of guiding the future of AI research. While the
            article uses a lot of secondary research, one could argue it doesn&rsquo;t use enough primary research.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Comparing the studies</u></strong></p>
          <p>The article in AI Magazine focuses on refining the research methodologies used in AI research, whereas the
            article from CIAT reviews AI research trends and offers insights into emerging areas of focus. The
            methodologies used in both articles are appropriate (reflective analysis in the article in AI magazine and a
            systematic review in the article from CIAT).</p>
          <p>Both articles rely on data from secondary sources instead of primary research which may cause one to
            question their validity. Regardless of this, both articles contributed significantly to AI research.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Future Enhancements </u></strong></p>
          <p>Both articles could be enhanced by integrating more empirical data, contemporary trends, and
            interdisciplinary perspectives to make them more applicable to the current and future directions of AI
            research. Additionally, they could incorporate primary research and quantitative analyses to provide
            stronger evidence for the arguments presented, with real-world case studies to have an immediate impact on
            AI research instead of being mainly theoretical.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
          <p>While both articles are mainly theoretical and could have benefited from primary research, they certainly
            do provide value in the field of AI research as they both contributed to the collective body of
            knowledge.</p>

          <h5>How the artefact relates to the module objectives</h5>
          <p>The Peer Review Activity in Unit 3 of the e-Portfolio plays a crucial role in reinforcing the module
            objectives by fostering critical evaluation, academic integrity, and research development skills. This
            activity aligns with the key learning goals of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module,
            particularly in relation to critical appraisal, academic investigation, and research proposal
            development.</p>
          <p>One of the primary objectives of the module is to evaluate critically existing literature, research design,
            and methodology for a chosen topic, including data analysis processes. The Peer Review Activity allows
            students to assess and provide constructive feedback on each other&rsquo;s research work, developing their
            ability to critically analyse academic writing, research methodologies, and data analysis techniques.
            Through this process, students refine their understanding of what constitutes robust and methodologically
            sound research, which directly contributes to their ability to assess reliability, validity, and ethical
            considerations in academic research.</p>
          <p>Additionally, this activity supports the objective to appraise the principles of academic investigation and
            apply them to a research topic in the applicable computing field. Engaging in peer review exposes students
            to different perspectives and methodologies used in computing research, allowing them to compare their own
            research approach with those of their peers. By identifying areas of strength and potential weaknesses in
            others&rsquo; work, students gain insight into common research pitfalls, best practices, and ways to enhance
            the clarity and effectiveness of academic writing.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the Peer Review Activity aligns with the module objective to produce and evaluate critically
            the resulting research proposal for the chosen topic. Reviewing and receiving feedback helps students refine
            their own research proposals, ensuring that their research questions, hypotheses, and methodological
            approaches are clearly defined, well-supported, and ethically sound. This iterative feedback process allows
            them to strengthen their proposals before final submission, improving the quality and rigour of their
            research design.</p>
          <p>Finally, this activity helps students appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical
            issues that affect computing professionals. When reviewing research related to computing, students must
            consider ethical aspects of data collection, bias in analysis, and responsible research practices. Engaging
            in peer review fosters a greater appreciation for the importance of academic integrity, transparency, and
            responsible dissemination of research findings, which are essential skills in both academia and professional
            practice.</p>

          <p><strong><u>Description</u></strong></p>
          <p>This unit was the third unit of the Research Methods and Professional Practices module. This unit focused
            on the different data collection methods as well as the different methods and methodologies used in
            research.</p>
          <p>For this unit we were required to read an extract from chapter 2 in the book &lsquo;Projects in Computing
            and Information Systems: A Student's Guide&rsquo; (Dawson, 2015), the article from the British Research
            Methodology on Research Design (BRM, 2018), the article from question pro on research (QuestionPro, 2021) in
            addition to watching the lecture from Sam Newington on research methods and methodologies (University of
            Liverpool, 2019) and going through the interactive methods map on research methods from Sage (Sage,
            2021).</p>
          <p>This unit consisted of two formative activities, a lecture cast, a lecture and a seminar preparation
            activity in addition to all the required reading. The formative activities for this unit were the summary
            post for the collaborative discussion on ethics and the portfolio activity related to the research proposal
            for the second assignment. The lecture cast for this unit focused on surveys and interviews in research and
            pre- and post-testing to prove or disprove a hypothesis. During the lecture Dr Outram went over the
            activities, we were expected to complete by the end of unit four as well as the different research and data
            collection methods so that we could begin working on the upcoming assignment. The seminar preparation
            activity we had to complete prior to the lecture was a peer review activity on AI research we had to compare
            research papers that used different research methods and had to answer the following questions; are the
            research questions and objectives in line with your thoughts on the topic, do they contribute to the
            collective body of knowledge, was the research methodology, data collection method and analysis appropriate,
            does each paper support its claims and conclusions with evidence and how could each study be enhanced.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Feelings</u></strong></p>
          <p>The inconsistencies on the learning platform caused me a great deal of confusion as the reading list
            contained duplicate entries from a previous unit and didn&rsquo;t match up with the reading list for the
            module. I wouldn&rsquo;t have expected to see this on a postgraduate course as it suggests a lack of care
            and attention to detail.</p>
          <p>I was perplexed by Dr Outram&rsquo;s contradiction when it came to referencing as she stressed the
            importance of not using sources without a date but then used them in multiple places on the learning
            platform.</p>
          <p>I noticed that a lot of the references on the learning platform didn't match up with the referencing guide
            provided by the university and some of them were incorrect (I.E they had the incorrect year). This is a
            worrying sign as it suggests the learning platform was put together in a rush and not double-checked for
            correctness.</p>
          <p>I felt as if the amount of reading for this unit was excessive as it&rsquo;s not realistic to expect
            part-time students to read so much in one week especially if they have other commitments.</p>
          <p>I was disappointed by the participation of the other students throughout the entirety of the collaborative
            discussion as very few people actively participated in the collaborative discussion. While this worry trend
            is something I have noticed throughout the entirety of my postgraduate degree, I would have expected more
            participation, especially at the beginning of a module.</p>
          <p>Again, I didn't receive the lecture slides in advance like I am supposed to according to my reasonable
            adjustment plan. This left me rather disappointed as what is the point of having a reasonable adjustment
            plan when it is never followed by the lectures. The idea behind receiving the lecture slides early is to
            allow me to be better prepared for the lectures and to save me the time I would spend re-watching the
            lectures to make notes. Due to the heavy workload of the unit to date, this is rather inconvenient. I hope
            this won&rsquo;t be a regular occurrence in this module as receiving the lecture slides early is extremely
            beneficial.</p>
          <p>Again, it seemed like Dr Outram was just reading off the slides during the lecture and the slides were very
            wordy. I would have expected Dr Outram to add some of her own insights as I didn&rsquo;t really gain any
            real value from attending the lecture, I could have just read the slides myself. I am concerned that if this
            continues, the attendance in the lectures will continue to fall.</p>
          <p>I feel as if the lectures could have been scheduled much better as 9:00 AM lectures are likely to have very
            poor attendance due to time zone differences. Other lecturers at least made an effort to accommodate
            international students and students with other commitments by having lectures at a reasonable time. I
            consider this very worrying as anyone working in the country where the university is based is unlikely to be
            able to attend the lectures due to their typical working hours.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Evaluation</u></strong></p>
          <p>The aspects of the unit that I feel went well were; all module goals were achieved, my ability to read
            and understand technical documents improved as I had a lot of reading to do for this unit of the module.</p>
          <p>While Dr Outram is good at keeping on top of the students making sure nobody falls behind, there is a lot
            of
            room for improvement in their presentation style as whenever you attend the lectures, all Dr Outram does is
            read off the slides.</p>
          <p>I was rather disappointed as I had high expectations for the module, however, after not receiving the
            lecture
            slides early for any lectures to date and noticing the sub-par attendance to the lectures, the sub-par
            participation in the collaborative discussions and the high number of mistakes on the learning platform, I
            have significantly lowered my expectations for the rest of the module.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Analysis</u></strong></p>
          <p>As I am planning on applying for PHD&rsquo;s learning how to do a research project is vital as a
            significant part of any doctorate is the research proposal.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
          <p>Over the course of the unit I learned about the research onion, the differences between quantitative
            research and qualitative research, the purpose of research, the different types of research, the different
            research strategies, the differences between secondary and primary research, the threats to reliability, the
            different types of validity and the different Quality criteria. As I had never done a research module prior
            to this, this was a module where I expected to learn a lot.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Action plan</u></strong></p>
          <p>If I was to redo this unit of the module, I would have managed my time better in the previous module and
            planned for being ill, so I wouldn't need to manage the workload of two modules for the first week as due to
            this I fell behind in this module and have been struggling to catch up due to the heavy work load.</p>

          <h5>How the artefact relates to the module objectives</h5>
          <p>The Unit 3 Reflection in the e-Portfolio is a significant component of the Research Methods and
            Professional Practice module, as it enables students to critically assess their learning experience in
            research methodologies, academic investigation, and ethical considerations. Reflection is essential in
            helping students consolidate their understanding of research concepts and recognise areas for improvement in
            their academic and professional development. By documenting their experiences in Unit 3, students gain a
            deeper appreciation of research methodology, ethical considerations, and the practical applications of
            research principles, which are core aspects of the module.</p>
          <p>One of the key module objectives is to appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical
            issues that affect computing professionals. The Unit 3 Reflection supports this objective by allowing
            students to explore the ethical considerations involved in conducting research. Research methodology
            decisions must account for ethical concerns such as bias, data protection, and the responsible use of
            information, ensuring that the study is conducted with integrity. Through reflection, students can assess
            how well they considered these ethical challenges in their research design and how they can improve their
            approach to align with professional ethical standards.</p>
          <p>Another major objective of the module is to appraise the principles of academic investigation and apply
            them to a research topic in computing. The Unit 3 Reflection provides an opportunity for students to analyse
            their ability to construct meaningful research questions, select appropriate methodologies, and justify
            their research decisions. Reflecting on their experience allows students to recognise the importance of
            choosing the right research methods&mdash;whether qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods&mdash;and how
            these methods affect data collection and analysis. This process enhances their ability to engage with
            academic research and apply theoretical knowledge to practical research challenges.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the module aims to evaluate critically existing literature, research design, and methodology
            for the chosen topic. The reflection process enables students to assess how effectively they engaged with
            literature in Unit 3 and whether their research design aligns with academic best practices. By considering
            the strengths and weaknesses of their chosen methodology, students can identify potential areas of
            improvement and refine their approach. Reflection also allows students to evaluate how well they interpreted
            and synthesised academic sources, ensuring that their research is well-grounded in existing scholarship.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the Unit 3 Reflection plays a crucial role in helping students meet the objective of producing
            and critically evaluating a research proposal for their chosen topic. Research proposals require careful
            planning, including defining research questions, formulating hypotheses, selecting an appropriate
            methodology, and addressing ethical concerns. Through reflection, students can recognise gaps in their
            research proposal and make the necessary improvements before finalising it. Self-assessment allows them to
            refine their arguments, ensure methodological rigour, and strengthen their overall proposal. This reflective
            process ensures that students develop a well-structured and academically sound research proposal that aligns
            with the expectations of scholarly research.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, the Unit 3 Reflection contributes significantly to achieving the Research Methods and
            Professional Practice module objectives. It allows students to analyse ethical concerns, apply principles of
            academic investigation, critically evaluate research methodologies, and improve their research proposals.
            Engaging in reflection fosters continuous learning, self-improvement, and the ability to conduct rigorous
            and responsible research. By reflecting on their learning experience, students become more adept at applying
            research methods, critically engaging with literature, and developing well-founded research proposals that
            contribute meaningfully to the field of computing.</p>
