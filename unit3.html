            <h5 id="collaborativeDiscussionSummaryPost">Collaborative Discussion 1 Summary Post</h5>
            <p><strong><u>Introduction </u></strong></p>
            <p>After reading through and contributing to the collaborative discussion posts from the other students and
              receiving feedback from Mario and Thomas on my initial post, I have learnt a lot about the importance of
              ethics in IT and the role it plays to ensure there has been no wrongdoing. I believe gaining insights from
              my peers is invaluable as they have a lot more experience than me and were able to provide insights that I
              had not previously considered.</p>
            <p>In my initial post, I explored the ethical, legal and social implications of the Malware Disruption case
              study provided by ACM (ACM, 2018). The case study looked at the mistakes made by Rouge Services and how
              they were complicit with Cyber-criminals using their web hosting services to perform malware attacks. Due
              to the laws surrounding malware varying from country to country, having a global consensus on the ethical
              considerations helps to ensure some form of consistency even if there are not legally binding.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Mario&rsquo;s Response</u></strong></p>
            <p>Mario suggested that I referenced how the ACM Code of Ethics (ACM, 2021) and the BCS Code of Conduct
              (BCS, 2022) are aligned as there is a lot of overlap between the two. When reading the posts of the other
              students, I noticed that some of the other students pointed how the specific sections of the ACM Code of
              Ethics are related to the BCS Code of Conduct. I thought this explanation added a lot of value to their
              post as it showed how while the ethical guidelines vary between organisations, the general principles are
              still the same. I agree with Mario that this explanation would have improved the quality of my initial
              post.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Thomas&rsquo;s Response</u></strong></p>
            <p>Thomas suggested that I considered the ethical implications of all those involved in the case study not
              just Rouge services. The reason I didn&rsquo;t do this in my initial post was due to the suggested word
              count. Even though I believe my reasoning for not adding this was valid, I agree with Thomas that my post
              could have benefited from the ethical concerns for those who built the worm that forcibly took Rouge
              Services offline as it would have demonstrated my ability to look at the bigger picture by considering the
              legal, ethical and social concerns for everyone involved. For example, while the intentions of the worm
              were to prevent any further harm, ultimately the worm caused harm to Rouges Services more legitimate
              clients, thereby breaking ethical principles related to unintentional harm and destruction of data even
              though they had good intentions. To quote Kristin Hannah, a number one New York Times bestselling author
              &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not intentions that matter, It&rsquo;s actions&rdquo;.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
            <p>While the ethical guidelines provided by ACM (ACM, 2021) and BCS (BCS, 2022) are good idea in theory as
              they are a useful tool in educating people on what it means to be ethical, the usefulness of them can be
              brought into question as they are not enforceable as they are merely guidelines and not laws as such
              individuals and organisations can choose to ignore them.</p>

          <!-- Seminar Preparation Activity Section -->
          <h5 id="seminarPreparationActivity">Seminar Preparation Activity</h5>
          <p><strong><u>Peer Review Activity</u></strong></p>
          <p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></p>
          <p>The two sources I will be reviewing in this peer review activity are the articles &lsquo;Artificial
            Intelligence Techniques and Methodology&rsquo; published in AI Magazine (Carbonell &amp; Sleeman, 1982) and
            &lsquo;Artificial Intelligence Research: A Review on Dominant Themes, Methods, Frameworks, and Future
            Research Directions&rsquo; from The Alliance of Biodiversity International and the International Center for
            Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) (Ofosu-Ampong, 2024).</p>
          <p><strong><u>Artificial Intelligence Techniques and Methodology</u></strong></p>
          <p>The article in AI Magazine analyses past AI research projects to guide future research. It combines a
            theoretical analysis with a reflection on the methods AI researchers use to address specific problems and
            proposes improvements to AI research methodologies through a meta-analysis. As the findings are theoretical,
            one could question the real-world value.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Artificial Intelligence Research: A Review on Dominant Themes, Methods, Frameworks, and Future
            Research Directions</u></strong></p>
          <p>The article from CIAT is a comprehensive literature review and thematic analysis of 85 peer reviewed
            articles on AI research themes and methodologies between 2020 and 2023. The article looks at emerging trends
            in technology and security issues with AI with the goal of guiding the future of AI research. While the
            article uses a lot of secondary research, one could argue it doesn&rsquo;t use enough primary research.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Comparing the studies</u></strong></p>
          <p>The article in AI Magazine focuses on refining the research methodologies used in AI research, whereas the
            article from CIAT reviews AI research trends and offers insights into emerging areas of focus. The
            methodologies used in both articles are appropriate (reflective analysis in the article in AI magazine and a
            systematic review in the article from CIAT).</p>
          <p>Both articles rely on data from secondary sources instead of primary research which may cause one to
            question their validity. Regardless of this, both articles contributed significantly to AI research.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Future Enhancements </u></strong></p>
          <p>Both articles could be enhanced by integrating more empirical data, contemporary trends, and
            interdisciplinary perspectives to make them more applicable to the current and future directions of AI
            research. Additionally, they could incorporate primary research and quantitative analyses to provide
            stronger evidence for the arguments presented, with real-world case studies to have an immediate impact on
            AI research instead of being mainly theoretical.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
          <p>While both articles are mainly theoretical and could have benefited from primary research, they certainly
            do provide value in the field of AI research as they both contributed to the collective body of
            knowledge.</p>

          <h5 id="reflection">Reflection</h5>
          <p><strong><u>Description</u></strong></p>
          <p>This unit was the third unit of the Research Methods and Professional Practices module. This unit focused
            on the different data collection methods as well as the different methods and methodologies used in
            research.</p>
          <p>For this unit we were required to read an extract from chapter 2 in the book &lsquo;Projects in Computing
            and Information Systems: A Student's Guide&rsquo; (Dawson, 2015), the article from the British Research
            Methodology on Research Design (BRM, 2018), the article from question pro on research (QuestionPro, 2021) in
            addition to watching the lecture from Sam Newington on research methods and methodologies (University of
            Liverpool, 2019) and going through the interactive methods map on research methods from Sage (Sage,
            2021).</p>
          <p>This unit consisted of two formative activities, a lecture cast, a lecture and a seminar preparation
            activity in addition to all the required reading. The formative activities for this unit were the summary
            post for the collaborative discussion on ethics and the portfolio activity related to the research proposal
            for the second assignment. The lecture cast for this unit focused on surveys and interviews in research and
            pre- and post-testing to prove or disprove a hypothesis. During the lecture Dr Outram went over the
            activities, we were expected to complete by the end of unit four as well as the different research and data
            collection methods so that we could begin working on the upcoming assignment. The seminar preparation
            activity we had to complete prior to the lecture was a peer review activity on AI research we had to compare
            research papers that used different research methods and had to answer the following questions; are the
            research questions and objectives in line with your thoughts on the topic, do they contribute to the
            collective body of knowledge, was the research methodology, data collection method and analysis appropriate,
            does each paper support its claims and conclusions with evidence and how could each study be enhanced.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Feelings</u></strong></p>
          <p>The inconsistencies on the learning platform caused me a great deal of confusion as the reading list
            contained duplicate entries from a previous unit and didn&rsquo;t match up with the reading list for the
            module. I wouldn&rsquo;t have expected to see this on a postgraduate course as it suggests a lack of care
            and attention to detail.</p>
          <p>I was perplexed by Dr Outram&rsquo;s contradiction when it came to referencing as she stressed the
            importance of not using sources without a date but then used them in multiple places on the learning
            platform.</p>
          <p>I noticed that a lot of the references on the learning platform didn't match up with the referencing guide
            provided by the university and some of them were incorrect (I.E they had the incorrect year). This is a
            worrying sign as it suggests the learning platform was put together in a rush and not double-checked for
            correctness.</p>
          <p>I felt as if the amount of reading for this unit was excessive as it&rsquo;s not realistic to expect
            part-time students to read so much in one week especially if they have other commitments.</p>
          <p>I was disappointed by the participation of the other students throughout the entirety of the collaborative
            discussion as very few people actively participated in the collaborative discussion. While this worry trend
            is something I have noticed throughout the entirety of my postgraduate degree, I would have expected more
            participation, especially at the beginning of a module.</p>
          <p>Again, I didn't receive the lecture slides in advance like I am supposed to according to my reasonable
            adjustment plan. This left me rather disappointed as what is the point of having a reasonable adjustment
            plan when it is never followed by the lectures. The idea behind receiving the lecture slides early is to
            allow me to be better prepared for the lectures and to save me the time I would spend re-watching the
            lectures to make notes. Due to the heavy workload of the unit to date, this is rather inconvenient. I hope
            this won&rsquo;t be a regular occurrence in this module as receiving the lecture slides early is extremely
            beneficial.</p>
          <p>Again, it seemed like Dr Outram was just reading off the slides during the lecture and the slides were very
            wordy. I would have expected Dr Outram to add some of her own insights as I didn&rsquo;t really gain any
            real value from attending the lecture, I could have just read the slides myself. I am concerned that if this
            continues, the attendance in the lectures will continue to fall.</p>
          <p>I feel as if the lectures could have been scheduled much better as 9:00 AM lectures are likely to have very
            poor attendance due to time zone differences. Other lecturers at least made an effort to accommodate
            international students and students with other commitments by having lectures at a reasonable time. I
            consider this very worrying as anyone working in the country where the university is based is unlikely to be
            able to attend the lectures due to their typical working hours.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Evaluation</u></strong></p>
          <p>The aspects of the unit that I feel went well were; all module goals were achieved, my ability to read
            and understand technical documents improved as I had a lot of reading to do for this unit of the module.</p>
          <p>While Dr Outram is good at keeping on top of the students making sure nobody falls behind, there is a lot
            of
            room for improvement in their presentation style as whenever you attend the lectures, all Dr Outram does is
            read off the slides.</p>
          <p>I was rather disappointed as I had high expectations for the module, however, after not receiving the
            lecture
            slides early for any lectures to date and noticing the sub-par attendance to the lectures, the sub-par
            participation in the collaborative discussions and the high number of mistakes on the learning platform, I
            have significantly lowered my expectations for the rest of the module.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Analysis</u></strong></p>
          <p>As I am planning on applying for PHD&rsquo;s learning how to do a research project is vital as a
            significant part of any doctorate is the research proposal.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
          <p>Over the course of the unit I learned about the research onion, the differences between quantitative
            research and qualitative research, the purpose of research, the different types of research, the different
            research strategies, the differences between secondary and primary research, the threats to reliability, the
            different types of validity and the different Quality criteria. As I had never done a research module prior
            to this, this was a module where I expected to learn a lot.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Action plan</u></strong></p>
          <p>If I was to redo this unit of the module, I would have managed my time better in the previous module and
            planned for being ill, so I wouldn't need to manage the workload of two modules for the first week as due to
            this I fell behind in this module and have been struggling to catch up due to the heavy work load.</p>
