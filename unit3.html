            <h5>How the research proposal review activity relates to the module objectives</h5>
            <p>The research proposal review activity aligns closely with the
              module objectives by fostering critical evaluation, research methodology assessment, and professional
              reflection, all of which are fundamental to academic and professional practice in computing.</p>
            <p>One of the key module objectives is to evaluate critically existing literature, research design, and
              methodology for a chosen topic, including data analysis processes. This activity directly contributes to
              this objective by requiring me to assess and critique research proposals, considering aspects such
              as the clarity of research questions, the appropriateness of selected methodologies, and the validity of
              data analysis techniques.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the activity supports the objective of appraising the principles of academic investigation
              and applying them to a research topic in computing. By analysing different research proposals, I
              developed a deeper understanding of how to construct well-founded research questions, justify methodological
              choices, and address potential limitations. This process reinforces the importance of academic rigour,
              logical structuring, and methodological soundness in research.</p>
            <p>In summary, this activity strengthened my ability to evaluate research critically, apply academic
              investigation principles, assess ethical considerations, and refine my own research proposals, making
              it an essential part of their learning journey in the Research Methods and Professional Practice
              module.</p>
            <!-- e-Portfolio Activity: Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 -->
            <h5 id="collaborativeDiscussionSummaryPost">Collaborative Discussion 1 Summary Post</h5>
            <p><strong><u>Introduction </u></strong></p>
            <p>After reading through and contributing to the collaborative discussion posts from the other students and
              receiving feedback from Mario and Thomas on my initial post, I have learnt a lot about the importance of
              ethics in IT and the role it plays to ensure there has been no wrongdoing. I believe gaining insights from
              my peers is invaluable as they have a lot more experience than me and were able to provide insights that I
              had not previously considered.</p>
            <p>In my initial post, I explored the ethical, legal and social implications of the malware disruption case
              study provided by ACM (ACM, 2018). The case study looked at the mistakes made by Rouge Services and how
              they were complicit with Cyber-criminals using their web hosting services to perform malware attacks. Due
              to the laws surrounding malware varying from country to country, having a global consensus on the ethical
              considerations helps to ensure some form of consistency even if there are not legally binding.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Mario&rsquo;s Response</u></strong></p>
            <p>Mario suggested that I referenced how the ACM Code of Ethics (ACM, 2021) and the BCS Code of Conduct
              (BCS, 2022) are aligned as there is a lot of overlap between the two. When reading the posts of the other
              students, I noticed that some of the other students pointed how the specific sections of the ACM Code of
              Ethics are related to the BCS Code of Conduct. I thought this explanation added a lot of value to their
              post as it showed how while the ethical guidelines vary between organisations, the general principles are
              still the same. I agree with Mario that this explanation would have improved the quality of my initial
              post.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Thomas&rsquo;s Response</u></strong></p>
            <p>Thomas suggested that I considered the ethical implications of all those involved in the case study not
              just Rouge services. The reason I didn&rsquo;t do this in my initial post was due to the suggested word
              count. Even though I believe my reasoning for not adding this was valid, I agree with Thomas that my post
              could have benefited from the ethical concerns for those who built the worm that forcibly took Rouge
              Services offline as it would have demonstrated my ability to look at the bigger picture by considering the
              legal, ethical and social concerns for everyone involved. For example, while the intentions of the worm
              were to prevent any further harm, ultimately the worm caused harm to Rouges Services more legitimate
              clients, thereby breaking ethical principles related to unintentional harm and destruction of data even
              though they had good intentions. To quote Kristin Hannah, a number one New York Times bestselling author
              &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not intentions that matter, It&rsquo;s actions&rdquo;.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
            <p>While the ethical guidelines provided by ACM (ACM, 2021) and BCS (BCS, 2022) are good idea in theory as
              they are a useful tool in educating people on what it means to be ethical, the usefulness of them can be
              brought into question as they are not enforceable as they are merely guidelines and not laws as such
              individuals and organisations can choose to ignore them.</p>

            <h5>How the collaborative discussion summary post relates to the module objectives</h5>
            <p>The Collaborative Discussion Summary Post is a critical component that
              aligns well with the module objectives by emphasising critical thinking, research evaluation, and
              professional engagement&mdash;all key skills in the Research Methods and Professional Practice module.</p>
            <p>One of the core objectives of the module is to appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural, and
              ethical issues that affect computing professionals. The summary post consolidates the insights gained from
              peer discussions, enabling me to reflect on diverse perspectives and ethical considerations
              presented during the collaborative discussion. This activity fostered an appreciation for how different viewpoints and
              approaches impact the application of research in real-world contexts, particularly within the computing
              field. By synthesising various ideas, I was encouraged to consider the broader implications of
              my research and professional decisions, aligning directly with the goal of ethical and socially
              responsible practice.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the activity addresses the module objective to evaluate critically existing literature,
              research design, and methodology for a chosen topic, including data analysis processes. Through discussion
              and summarisation, I engaged deeply with research topics, identifying key themes, methodologies, and
              gaps in the literature. The summary post helped me consolidate my understanding of effective
              research design, data analysis strategies, and the critical evaluation of sources. It enhanced my
              ability to recognise the strengths and limitations of different research approaches, a skill that is
              crucial when assessing my own and others&rsquo; work.</p>
            <p>The collaborative discussion summary post also supports the objective of appraising the principles of
              academic investigation and applying them to a research topic in the applicable computing field. This
              activity required me to integrate and reflect on feedback received from my peers, encouraging
              me to refine my research approach based on constructive critique. By summarising the main points of
              discussion, I demonstrated my ability to extract relevant information, connect theoretical
              concepts to practical applications, and apply academic investigation principles to computing-related
              issues.</p>
            <p>Finally, the summary post contributes to the objective of producing and critically evaluating a research
              proposal for a chosen topic. The insights gained from discussions with peers provided valuable feedback
              that can be integrated into the research proposal development process. It encouraged me to think
              critically about my research questions, methodologies, and the overall design of my projects. By
              reflecting on the collaborative discussions, I identified areas for improvement in my research
              proposal, leading to a more robust and well-structured research plan.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the collaborative discussion summary post is integral to achieving the module objectives
              by reinforcing my abilities to critically evaluate research, engage with ethical and
              professional issues, apply academic investigation principles, and refine my research proposals. It
              provided me with an opportunity for deeper reflection and synthesis of ideas, enhancing my overall learning
              experience and preparing me for future challenges in the field of computing.</p>

          <p><strong><u>Peer Review Activity</u></strong></p>
          <p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></p>
          <p>The two sources I will be reviewing in this peer review activity are the articles &lsquo;Artificial
            Intelligence Techniques and Methodology&rsquo; published in AI Magazine (Carbonell &amp; Sleeman, 1982) and
            &lsquo;Artificial Intelligence Research: A Review on Dominant Themes, Methods, Frameworks, and Future
            Research Directions&rsquo; from The Alliance of Biodiversity International and the International Center for
            Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) (Ofosu-Ampong, 2024).</p>
          <p><strong><u>Artificial Intelligence Techniques and Methodology</u></strong></p>
          <p>The article in AI Magazine analyses past AI research projects to guide future research. It combines a
            theoretical analysis with a reflection on the methods AI researchers use to address specific problems and
            proposes improvements to AI research methodologies through a meta-analysis. As the findings are theoretical,
            one could question the real-world value.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Artificial Intelligence Research: A Review on Dominant Themes, Methods, Frameworks, and Future
            Research Directions</u></strong></p>
          <p>The article from CIAT is a comprehensive literature review and thematic analysis of 85 peer reviewed
            articles on AI research themes and methodologies between 2020 and 2023. The article looks at emerging trends
            in technology and security issues with AI with the goal of guiding the future of AI research. While the
            article uses a lot of secondary research, one could argue it doesn&rsquo;t use enough primary research.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Comparing the studies</u></strong></p>
          <p>The article in AI Magazine focuses on refining the research methodologies used in AI research, whereas the
            article from CIAT reviews AI research trends and offers insights into emerging areas of focus. The
            methodologies used in both articles are appropriate (reflective analysis in the article in AI magazine and a
            systematic review in the article from CIAT).</p>
          <p>Both articles rely on data from secondary sources instead of primary research which may cause one to
            question their validity. Regardless of this, both articles contributed significantly to AI research.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Future Enhancements </u></strong></p>
          <p>Both articles could be enhanced by integrating more empirical data, contemporary trends, and
            interdisciplinary perspectives to make them more applicable to the current and future directions of AI
            research. Additionally, they could incorporate primary research and quantitative analyses to provide
            stronger evidence for the arguments presented, with real-world case studies to have an immediate impact on
            AI research instead of being mainly theoretical.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
          <p>While both articles are mainly theoretical and could have benefited from primary research, they certainly
            do provide value in the field of AI research as they both contributed to the collective body of
            knowledge.</p>

          <h5>How the peer review activity relates to the module objectives</h5>
          <p>The peer review activity plays a crucial role in reinforcing the module
            objectives by fostering critical evaluation, academic integrity, and research development skills. This
            activity aligns with the key learning goals of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module,
            particularly in relation to critical appraisal, academic investigation, and research proposal
            development.</p>
          <p>One of the primary objectives of the module is to evaluate critically existing literature, research design,
            and methodology for a chosen topic, including data analysis processes. The peer review activity allowed
            me to assess and provide constructive feedback on my work, developing my
            ability to critically analyse academic writing, research methodologies, and data analysis techniques.
            Through this process, I refined my understanding of what constitutes robust and methodologically
            sound research, which directly contributes to my ability to assess reliability, validity, and ethical
            considerations in academic research.</p>
          <p>Additionally, this activity supports the objective to appraise the principles of academic investigation and
            apply them to a research topic in the applicable computing field. Engaging in peer review exposed me
            to different perspectives and methodologies used in computing research, allowing me to compare my own
            research approach with my peers. By identifying areas of strength and potential weaknesses in
            others&rsquo; work, I gained insight into common research pitfalls, best practices, and ways to enhance
            the clarity and effectiveness of academic writing.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the Peer Review Activity aligns with the module objective to produce and evaluate critically
            the resulting research proposal for the chosen topic. Reviewing and receiving feedback helped me refine
            my research proposal, ensuring that my research questions, hypotheses, and methodological
            approaches are clearly defined, well-supported, and ethically sound. This iterative feedback process allowed
            me to strengthen my proposals before final submission, improving the quality and rigour of my
            research design.</p>
          <p>Finally, this activity helped me appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical
            issues that affect computing professionals. When reviewing research related to computing, I
            considered the ethical aspects of data collection, bias in analysis, and responsible research practices. Engaging
            in peer review fosters a greater appreciation for the importance of academic integrity, transparency, and
            responsible dissemination of research findings, which are essential skills in both academia and professional
            practice.</p>

          <p><strong><u>Description</u></strong></p>
          <p>Unit 3 of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module focused on research evaluation, peer
            review, and refining research proposals. A significant part of this unit was dedicated to understanding the
            importance of reviewing existing literature critically and evaluating different research methodologies.
            Additionally, the unit introduced peer review as a crucial element of academic research, emphasising the
            role of constructive feedback in refining research quality.</p>
          <p>As part of this unit, I engaged in several activities, including the Research Proposal Review Activity,
            Peer Review Activity, and the Collaborative Discussion Summary Post. These tasks required me to critically
            assess research proposals, provide structured feedback to peers, and reflect on the key takeaways from
            collaborative discussions. By participating in these activities, I had the opportunity to apply critical
            thinking skills and develop a deeper understanding of research design and academic critique.</p>
          <p>Additionally, this unit reinforced the significance of academic integrity and ethical considerations in
            peer review. It emphasised the importance of providing honest, objective, and constructive feedback to
            ensure that research is rigorous, credible, and ethically sound. This process was particularly insightful,
            as it allowed me to analyse various research approaches and methodologies, identifying their strengths and
            weaknesses while also receiving feedback on my own work.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Feelings</u></strong></p>
          <p>At the beginning of Unit 3, I felt somewhat uncertain about my ability to critically evaluate research
            proposals and provide constructive feedback to peers. While I was familiar with literature reviews, I had
            limited experience in assessing the quality of research methodologies and identifying gaps in research
            designs. The idea of reviewing another person's research work seemed challenging because I was unsure
            whether my feedback would be insightful or helpful enough.</p>
          <p>However, as I progressed through the unit, my confidence grew. Engaging in peer review activities and
            discussions with classmates allowed me to see different perspectives and research approaches. This
            experience was particularly valuable because it helped me understand the common pitfalls in research
            proposals, such as unclear research questions, weak justifications for methodologies, and lack of strong
            supporting evidence from literature.</p>
          <p>Receiving feedback on my own research proposal was both constructive and eye-opening. Some of the comments
            pointed out areas for improvement that I had overlooked, such as refining my research questions and
            justifying my choice of data collection methods. While I initially felt slightly defensive about some
            critiques, I soon realised that peer feedback was instrumental in strengthening the quality of my work. This
            experience highlighted the importance of academic collaboration and critical discourse in refining research
            ideas.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Evaluation</u></strong></p>
          <p>Overall, Unit 3 was incredibly beneficial in developing my research evaluation and peer review skills. One
            of my key strengths in this unit was my ability to identify inconsistencies in research proposals and
            suggest constructive improvements. Through structured peer review exercises, I became more adept at
            assessing the clarity of research objectives, the feasibility of methodologies, and the reliability of data
            analysis approaches.</p>
          <p>However, one of the challenges I faced was articulating my feedback in a balanced and professional manner.
            Initially, I found it difficult to provide critical yet constructive comments without sounding overly
            critical or vague. However, by analysing peer-reviewed articles and instructor feedback, I learned how to
            frame my critiques in a way that was both supportive and insightful.</p>
          <p>Additionally, I found that reviewing other students' proposals helped me recognise gaps in my own research
            approach. Seeing different ways of structuring literature reviews and research justifications provided me
            with ideas for improving my own work. This highlighted an important takeaway&mdash;peer review is a two-way
            learning process, where both the reviewer and the reviewee benefit from exchanging feedback.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Analysis</u></strong></p>
          <p>The activities in Unit 3 reinforced the importance of peer review in academic research. In academic
            publishing, research must go through a rigorous peer review process before being accepted for publication.
            This ensures that the research is valid, reliable, and contributes meaningfully to existing knowledge
            (Smith, 2020). By engaging in peer review, I gained first-hand experience of how academic scrutiny and
            feedback contribute to refining research quality.</p>
          <p>This unit also emphasised the role of critical thinking in evaluating research methodologies. I learned
            that research should not only be assessed for its findings but also for the strength of its design,
            reliability of data sources, and justification of methodologies (Bryman, 2016). Understanding these aspects
            helped me improve my ability to identify potential biases, research limitations, and methodological flaws in
            academic studies.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, Unit 3 deepened my understanding of ethical considerations in peer review. Ethical peer review
            requires honesty, fairness, and objectivity to ensure that research is evaluated based on merit rather than
            personal bias (Resnik, 2019). I recognised that providing vague or overly harsh criticism could be
            detrimental to the research process, whereas constructive and well-supported feedback fosters
            improvement.</p>
          <p>Additionally, I realised that evaluating research is an ongoing skill that improves with practice. By
            actively participating in collaborative discussions and reviewing multiple research proposals, I was able to
            refine my ability to assess research quality effectively. This will be particularly useful when conducting
            my own research, as I now have a clearer framework for evaluating literature, designing methodologies, and
            anticipating potential challenges.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
          <p>Unit 3 was instrumental in enhancing my ability to critically evaluate research, engage in peer review, and
            refine my own research proposals. It provided a valuable opportunity to develop key academic skills,
            including assessing research quality, structuring feedback, and improving research clarity.</p>
          <p>One of the most significant takeaways was that peer feedback is an essential part of academic growth. While
            it may initially seem daunting, receiving constructive criticism allows researchers to refine their work and
            ensure methodological rigour. Additionally, reviewing others' research helped me identify gaps in my own
            work, reinforcing the value of collaborative learning in research settings.</p>
          <p>Although I improved in analysing research methodologies and providing structured feedback, I recognise that
            there is always room for growth. Developing stronger argumentation skills and improving the depth of my
            critiques are areas that I intend to work on further.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Action Plan</u></strong></p>
          <p>To enhance my research evaluation and peer review skills, I will implement the following strategies:
            firstly, I will engage in regular peer review exercises by participating in academic research forums and
            peer feedback sessions with classmates. Reviewing research proposals and published papers will allow me to
            practice evaluating research critically and constructively.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I will improve my research methodology analysis by exploring additional academic resources on
            research design, data collection techniques, and statistical analysis (Bryman, 2016). Attending workshops on
            qualitative and quantitative research methods will help strengthen my ability to critically assess
            methodologies.</p>
          <p>Additionally, I will refine my argumentation and feedback structuring by studying best practices for
            providing academic feedback. Ensuring that my critiques are clear, constructive, and well-supported (Resnik,
            2019) will be a key focus. Practicing writing structured research critiques will improve my ability to
            articulate research strengths and weaknesses more effectively.</p>
          <p>Finally, I will continue strengthening my ethical awareness in peer review by familiarising myself with
            academic integrity policies and ethical peer review guidelines from institutions such as the British
            Computer Society (BCS) and ACM. Ensuring that my feedback remains unbiased, professional, and ethical will
            be a key focus moving forward.</p>
          <p>By implementing these strategies, I aim to further enhance my research evaluation abilities, improve my
            feedback structuring, and strengthen my critical thinking skills in research review processes.</p>

          <h5>How the reflection relates to the module objectives</h5>
          <p>The Unit 3 reflection is a significant component of the Research Methods and
            Professional Practice module, as it enabled me to critically assess my learning experience in
            research methodologies, academic investigation, and ethical considerations. Reflection is essential in
            helping students consolidate their understanding of research concepts and recognise areas for improvement in
            their academic and professional development. By documenting my experiences in Unit 3, I gained a
            deeper appreciation of research methodology, ethical considerations, and the practical applications of
            research principles, which are core aspects of the module.</p>
          <p>One of the key module objectives is to appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical
            issues that affect computing professionals. The Unit 3 reflection supports this objective by allowing
            me to explore the ethical considerations involved in conducting research. Research methodology
            decisions must account for ethical concerns such as bias, data protection, and the responsible use of
            information, ensuring that the study is conducted with integrity. Through reflection, I assessed
            how well I considered the ethical challenges in my research design and how I can improve my
            approach to align with professional ethical standards.</p>
          <p>Another major objective of the module is to appraise the principles of academic investigation and apply
            them to a research topic in computing. The Unit 3 reflection provided me with an opportunity to analyse
            my ability to construct meaningful research questions, select appropriate methodologies, and justify
            my research decisions. Reflecting on my experience allowed me to recognise the importance of
            choosing the right research methods&mdash;whether qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods&mdash;and how
            these methods affect data collection and analysis. This process enhanced my ability to engage with
            academic research and apply theoretical knowledge to practical research challenges.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the module aims to evaluate critically existing literature, research design, and methodology
            for the chosen topic. The reflection process allowed me to assess how effectively I engaged with the
            literature in Unit 3 and whether my research design aligns with academic best practices. By considering
            the strengths and weaknesses of my chosen methodology, I can identify potential areas of
            improvement and refine my approach. Reflection also allows me to evaluate how well I interpreted
            and synthesised academic sources, ensuring that my research is well-grounded in existing scholarship.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the Unit 3 reflection plays a crucial role in helping me meet the objective of producing
            and critically evaluating a research proposal for my chosen topic. Research proposals require careful
            planning, including defining research questions, formulating hypotheses, selecting an appropriate
            methodology, and addressing ethical concerns. Through reflection, I learnt how to recognise gaps in my
            research proposal and make the necessary improvements before finalising it. Self-assessment allows me to
            refine my arguments, ensure methodological rigour, and strengthen my overall proposal. This reflective
            process ensures that I developed a well-structured and academically sound research proposal that aligns
            with the expectations of scholarly research.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, the Unit 3 reflection contributes significantly to achieving the Research Methods and
            Professional Practice module objectives. It allowed me to analyse ethical concerns, apply principles of
            academic investigation, critically evaluate research methodologies, and improve my research proposal.
            Engaging in reflection fosters continuous learning, self-improvement, and the ability to conduct rigorous
            and responsible research. By reflecting on my learning experience, I can become more adept at applying
            research methods, critically engaging with literature, and developing well-founded research proposals that
            contribute meaningfully to the field of computing.</p>
