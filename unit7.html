            <h5>How the literature review assignment relates to the module objectives</h5>
            <p>The literature review assignment directly relates to several module objectives by fostering critical
            engagement with existing research, refining academic investigation skills, and strengthening research design
            capabilities. One of the key objectives of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module is to
            evaluate critically existing literature, research design, and methodology for a chosen topic, including data
            analysis processes. Through this assignment, I was required to assess current scholarly works,
            identifying research gaps, key debates, and methodological approaches. By doing so, I was able to
            develop a nuanced understanding of the theoretical and empirical foundations of my chosen research topic.
            This process also helped me to distinguish between high-quality, peer-reviewed studies and less rigorous
            sources, a crucial skill for conducting academic research effectively.</p>
          <p>Another essential module objective is to appraise the principles of academic investigation and apply them
            to a research topic in the computing field. The literature review required me to engage with
            different research methodologies, comparing their strengths and limitations. This was particularly valuable
            in refining my ability to choose appropriate research designs and data collection techniques for my own
            research. By critically analysing different methodological approaches, I gained insight into how various
            methods contribute to the reliability and validity of research findings. This aligns with the broader aim of
            the module, which encourages students to develop methodologically sound research proposals that are grounded
            in well-established academic practices.</p>
          <p>The assignment also supported the module objective of appraising the professional, legal, social, cultural,
            and ethical issues that affect computing professionals. As part of my literature review, I had to consider
            ethical concerns related to data privacy, research integrity, and informed consent&mdash;key issues that are
            particularly relevant in the field of computing. By critically evaluating literature that addressed ethical
            considerations, I was able to develop a stronger awareness of how ethical principles influence research
            design and implementation. This aligns with the broader professional responsibility of computing
            professionals to ensure that research is conducted in an ethical and socially responsible manner.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the literature review was instrumental in helping me to produce and critically evaluate my
            research proposal, another key module objective. A well-structured literature review forms the foundation of
            a strong research proposal, as it allows researchers to justify the significance of their study, demonstrate
            familiarity with existing work, and position their research within the broader academic discourse. By
            systematically reviewing past studies, I was able to identify key themes, contradictions, and areas where
            further research was needed, which helped to shape the direction of my proposal. This process also
            reinforced the importance of clear argumentation and logical structuring in academic writing&mdash;skills
            that are essential for producing high-quality research outputs.</p>
          <p>Overall, the literature review assignment played a crucial role in developing my critical thinking,
            academic writing, and research design skills, all of which are fundamental to the objectives of the module.
            By engaging with existing literature, assessing methodological approaches, and considering ethical
            implications, I was able to enhance my ability to conduct independent research and apply theoretical
            knowledge to practical investigations. This assignment not only prepared me for future research projects but
            also helped to strengthen my competencies as a computing professional operating within an evolving and
            ethically complex field.</p>

            <h5 id="InappropriateUseOfSurveysActivity">Collaborative Discussion Two - Initial Post</h5>
            <p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></p>
            <p>In the case study, Abi was responsible for analysing the nutritional values of a new cereal named Whizzz.
              Whilst reviewing the collected data, Abi encounters an ethical dilemma as whilst their finding suggests
              Whizzz is less nutritious than claimed and may even be harmful, there are statistical approaches; they
              could employ to highlight correlations that portray the product in a more favourable light. This scenario
              raises questions about the ethical use of data, the responsibilities of researchers and the potential
              consequences of their decisions. In this post, I aim to explore these issues from ethical, legal, social
              and professional perspectives while providing recommendations for Abi.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Ethical Considerations</u></strong></p>
            <p>Maintaining integrity in research is of the utmost importance as ethical standards demand honesty and
              transparency. Manipulating or selectively reporting data to support a specific outcome even if it is
              technically accurate, is unethical. Doing so could distort the truth, mislead stakeholders or undermine
              public trust in scientific research. This idea is reinforced by the British Psychological Society&rsquo;s
              Code of Human Research Ethics which states &ldquo;researchers are obligated to ensure their work does not
              mislead or harm&rdquo; (British Psychological Society, 2014).</p>
            <p>Abi must consider whether they have a moral obligation to present both the positive and negative aspects
              of their findings. Selectively using statistics to highlight one particular outcome may be perceived as
              &ldquo;cherry-picking&rdquo; which compromises the credibility of the data and leads to a distorted
              representation of reality (Benos et al., 2007). Ethical research requires a balanced presentation of
              results to ensure objectivity and transparency.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Legal and Professional Responsibility</u></strong></p>
            <p>There are plenty of legal and professional considerations that Abi must consider. For example, in the
              United Kingdom, misleading claims about products are subject to legal scrutiny due to the Unfair Trading
              Regulations (UK Government, 2008) which prohibit deceptive advertising practices that could harm
              consumers. As a result of this, if the manufacturer uses Abi&rsquo;s findings selectively to promote
              Whizzz as nutritious while disregarding evidence to the contrary, Abi may be found complicit in the eyes
              of the law.</p>
            <p>Abi must adhere to codes of conduct established within their field, which prioritise responsibility,
              accuracy, and the prevention of harm. Allowing the misuse of their analyses could damage Abi&rsquo;s
              reputation, the institution's creditability, and the broader scientific community. Therefore, Abi has a
              responsibility to ensure their work is used ethically and responsibly by the manufacturer.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Social and Professional Impact</u></strong></p>
            <p>Abi&rsquo;s decisions carry significant social implications concerning public health and trust in
              research. Misrepresenting the nutritional value of Whizzz could mislead consumers into making dietary
              choices that harm their health and has the potential to damage public confidence in the scientific process
              and negatively impact the credibility of researchers and institutions. Research has shown that the spread
              of biased or misleading research findings erodes trust in scientific research, hindering its ability to
              effectively serve society (Loannidis, 2005).</p>
            <p>Abi is accountable for the outcomes of their work even if they are not directly responsible for how the
              manufacturer uses their findings, they have a duty to advocate for the ethical application of their
              results. By adopting a proactive approach, Abi can help to mitigate the risks associated with the misuse
              of their analyses.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Recommendations</u></strong></p>
            <p>To tackle the social, ethical and legal challenges present in the case study Abi should take several
              steps. Firstly, they must present both the positive and negative findings from their analyses to ensure
              transparency, objectivity and honesty. Secondly, Abi should communicate to the manufacturer the potential
              ethical and legal risks associated with selective reporting. Thirdly, Abi should consider publishing their
              findings in a peer-reviewed journal to ensure accountability and transparency. Lastly, Abi should include
              any disclaimers or contractual agreements to help prevent the misuse of their analyses.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
            <p>Abi&rsquo;s situation highlights the connection between ethical responsibility, legal accountability, and
              societal impact in research. By maintaining transparency, advocating for the ethical use of data, and
              considering the wider implications of their actions, Abi can fulfil their professional obligations while
              protecting public trust and safety. Ultimately, a commitment to ethical principles will enhance Abi's
              integrity as a researcher and contribute to the credibility and value of scientific inquiry.</p>

            <h6>Response 1</h6>
            <p>Hello Samuel,</p>
            <p>Including disclaimers or contractual agreements is a strong approach to preventing the misuse of Abi's
              analyses. While disclaimers provide clarity on the intended scope and limitations of the work, contractual
              agreements take ethical safeguards further by legally binding all parties to specific responsibilities and
              standards.</p>
            <p>The idea of a contractual agreement is particularly compelling, as it helps establish clear obligations,
              manage relationships, and promote ethical accountability between involved parties (Beck &amp; Purcell,
              2023). Such agreements align with the principles of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct and
              the BCS Code of Conduct, which emphasise the importance of avoiding harm and acting in the public
              interest.</p>
            <p>For Abi, including ethical clauses in a contract could explicitly define acceptable uses of the analyses
              and specify consequences for misuse. This approach not only deters potential harm but also reflects a
              proactive commitment to transparency and trust. By integrating these measures, Abi would ensure their work
              aligns with professional and societal values, strengthening accountability and reinforcing ethical

            <h6>Response 2</h6>
            <p>Hello Samuel,<br><br> Thank you for your insightful comments and analysis. I appreciate how you&rsquo;ve
              categorised the consequences of Abi&rsquo;s actions into ethical, legal, social, and professional
              dimensions, making it easier to understand the situation's complexity. Additionally, your focus on
              proactive solutions and recommendations demonstrates a clear commitment to addressing Abi's ethical
              challenges.<br> Your suggestion to include disclaimers and contractual agreements is particularly
              noteworthy. Furthermore, publishing in a peer-reviewed journal is another approach that piqued my
              interest. These strategies could indeed serve as safeguards to prevent misuse of Abi&rsquo;s analysis.
              However, I would like to expand on this idea.<br><br> For instance, a disclaimer could help protect
              against reputation harm, clarifying that the findings should not be used selectively. A contractual
              agreement gives Abi more control over the use of their findings by the manufacturer, ensuring that the
              results are used responsibly and ethically.<br><br> On the other hand, publishing research in an
              open-access format can enhance accessibility, aligning with the European Commission's Horizon 2020 Open
              Access policy. Making the findings openly available provides transparency. However, this also means that
              Abi would need to be cautious about how their work is interpreted or misused by others&nbsp;(European
              Commission, N.D.).</p>
            <p>These approaches, when combined, can provide both transparency and protection for Abi&rsquo;s work,
              ensuring that their ethical and legal responsibilities are upheld.<br><br>Reference:<br><br>European

            <h5>How the initial post for the second collaborative discussion relates to the module objectives</h5>
            <p>The collaborative discussion post 
              directly aligns with the module objectives by fostering critical engagement with statistical inference,
              hypothesis testing, and their applications in computing research. This activity required students to apply
              inferential statistics to data analysis, encouraging them to critically assess how statistical methods can
              be used to draw meaningful conclusions from sample data and make generalisations about larger
              populations.</p>
            <p>One of the key module objectives is to appraise the principles of academic investigation and apply them
              to a research topic in the applicable computing field. Through the collaborative discussion, I
              engaged with the core principles of inferential statistics, examining how probability distributions,
              confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing contribute to statistically valid research conclusions. By
              discussing these topics in a structured manner, I improved my ability to apply statistical
              reasoning to computing research problems, such as performance evaluation in machine learning models,
              cybersecurity risk assessment, or software reliability testing.</p>
            <p>Additionally, this activity supports the module objective of evaluating critically existing literature,
              research design, and methodology, including data analysis processes. Engaging in a discussion about
              hypothesis testing required me to assess different statistical approaches, consider their
              limitations, and justify the choice of statistical tests based on research design. This process involved
              interpreting real-world research examples in computing and assessing the strengths and weaknesses of
              statistical methodologies used. By critically evaluating different approaches, I strengthened my
              ability to identify potential biases, limitations, and ethical concerns in data analysis.</p>
            <p>The discussion also relates to the module objective of appraising the professional, legal, social,
              cultural, and ethical issues that affect computing professionals. Statistical inference plays a crucial
              role in decision-making, and errors in statistical reasoning can lead to misleading conclusions, biased
              research findings, and unethical practices. The discussion encouraged me to reflect on ethical
              concerns in data interpretation, issues of data manipulation, and the importance of transparency in
              reporting statistical results. These considerations are particularly relevant in AI development, big data
              analytics, and cybersecurity, where data-driven decisions impact users, businesses, and society.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the collaborative discussion supports the objective of producing and
              critically evaluating a research proposal for the chosen topic. A well-structured research proposal must
              include a valid and appropriate statistical methodology to analyse collected data. By discussing
              inferential statistics and hypothesis testing, I gained practical insights into selecting the right
              statistical tools, ensuring my research is methodologically sound and capable of producing valid,
              reliable, and generalisable results.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, this collaborative discussion activity significantly contributed to achieving the module&rsquo;s
              objectives by encouraging students to apply inferential statistics in research, critically assess
              statistical methodologies, reflect on ethical issues in data interpretation, and integrate sound
              statistical reasoning into their research proposals.</p>
            <h4>Summary Measures Worksheet</h4>
            <h5>How the artefacts in the summary measures worksheet relate to the module objectives</h5>
            <p>The summary measures worksheet is
              directly aligned with the module objectives by providing hands-on experience with descriptive statistics
              and data analysis techniques, which are essential for conducting academic research in computing.</p>
            <p>One of the core module objectives is to appraise the principles of academic investigation and apply them
              to a research topic in the applicable computing field. The worksheet required students to engage with
              summary statistics, such as measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion
              (standard deviation, variance, interquartile range). These statistical tools are fundamental in analysing
              datasets, identifying patterns, and making data-driven decisions&mdash;skills that are crucial for
              research in computing disciplines such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and software
              engineering.</p>
            <p>The worksheet also supports the objective of evaluating critically existing literature, research design,
              and methodology, including data analysis processes. Through the completion of statistical calculations and
              data interpretations, I gained the ability to assess the reliability and significance of research
              findings. Understanding summary measures helped me interpret empirical studies, design experiments,
              and validate research hypotheses. This knowledge is vital for ensuring that data analysis is both
              accurate and methodologically sound in computing research.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the summary measures worksheet aligns with the module objective of appraising the
              professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical issues that affect computing professionals. In
              computing research, quantitative data analysis plays a key role in decision-making, whether it is for
              evaluating cybersecurity risks, assessing software performance, or understanding user behaviour in digital
              systems. Ethical considerations, such as bias in data collection, manipulation of statistics, and
              misinterpretation of results, must be accounted for when working with numerical datasets. By working
              through the worksheet, I developed an awareness of these ethical concerns and learned how to apply
              statistical techniques responsibly.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the worksheet contributes to the objective of producing and evaluating critically the
              resulting research proposal for the chosen topic. Research proposals often involve justifying data
              collection methods and defining the statistical techniques that will be used for analysis. The ability to
              calculate and interpret summary measures allowed me to justify my chosen methodology and ensure
              that my data analysis approach aligns with the research objectives. This competency is crucial for
              constructing well-founded research proposals that meet academic and professional standards.</p>
            <p>In conclusion the summary measures worksheet is a practical exercise that reinforces the application of descriptive
              statistics in research. By engaging with statistical methods, I enhanced my ability to analyse
              data, interpret results, and apply quantitative reasoning to computing-related problems. This activity
              strengthened my research skills, critical evaluation abilities, and ethical awareness in data analysis,
              ensuring alignment with the broader module objectives.</p>

            <h4>Hypothesis Testing Worksheet</h4>
            <h5>How the artefacts in the hypothesis testing worksheet relate to the module objectives</h5>
            <p>The hypothesis testing worksheet plays
              a crucial role in aligning with the module&rsquo;s objectives by reinforcing statistical inference
              principles, data-driven decision-making, and the critical evaluation of research findings in computing.
              Hypothesis testing is a fundamental aspect of research methodology, particularly in computing disciplines
              where empirical validation is necessary for software performance, machine learning models, and
              cybersecurity risk assessment.</p>
            <p>One of the core module objectives is to appraise the principles of academic investigation and apply them
              to a research topic in the applicable computing field. The worksheet allowed me to gain hands-on
              experience in applying various hypothesis testing methods, such as t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA,
              which are commonly used in computing research to assess performance metrics, compare system efficiencies,
              or evaluate user behaviour. By engaging with this exercise, I developed the ability to make informed
              decisions based on statistical evidence, ensuring that my research findings are not based on
              assumptions but rather on quantifiable and verifiable data.</p>
            <p>Another significant module objective is to evaluate critically existing literature, research design, and
              methodology, including data analysis processes. The hypothesis testing worksheet supports this objective
              by providing students with practical exposure to analysing research data, interpreting statistical
              results, and assessing the validity of conclusions drawn from empirical studies. Many research papers in
              computing fields rely on hypothesis testing to validate claims, and by working through this worksheet,
              I developed a deeper understanding of how statistical significance, confidence intervals, and
              p-values contribute to research rigour. This enhanced my ability to critically assess published
              research and determine the reliability and applicability of my findings.</p>
            <p>In addition to technical and methodological competencies, the worksheet also contributes to the appraisal
              of professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical issues that affect computing professionals. Ethical
              considerations in hypothesis testing are paramount, particularly in avoiding misrepresentation of results,
              p-hacking (selectively reporting only significant results), and improper data handling. These concerns are
              especially relevant in computing research, where statistical findings can influence decision-making in
              areas such as cybersecurity risk assessments, artificial intelligence, and public policy. By completing
              the worksheet, I developed an ethical approach to statistical analysis, ensuring that my research
              adheres to best practices in transparency, integrity, and responsible reporting of data.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the module objective of producing and critically evaluating a research proposal is also
              reinforced through the completion of the hypothesis testing worksheet. When formulating research proposals
              in computing, students must not only define a clear research problem but also justify their choice of
              statistical methods, hypothesis testing approaches, and expected outcomes. By practising hypothesis
              testing, students strengthen their ability to integrate statistical reasoning into their research design,
              ensuring that their proposed investigations are methodologically sound. Understanding how to apply
              hypothesis testing allows students to confidently design studies that produce valid and reliable results,
              which is a critical skill in both academic and professional research settings.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the Hypothesis Testing Worksheet serves as an integral learning tool within the Research
              Methods and Professional Practice module. It enhances students' ability to conduct rigorous data analysis,
              interpret statistical findings responsibly, and incorporate hypothesis testing into their academic
              research and professional practice. By completing this exercise, I improved my ability to appraise
              research methodologies, uphold ethical research standards, and apply statistical reasoning to real-world
              computing problems, ensuring alignment with the module&rsquo;s objectives and preparing me for future
              research endeavours in the field of computing.</p>

            <h5>Example 7.2</h5>
            <p>Example 7.2 asked us to use a spreadsheet file that wasn't provided, so I was unable to complete the
              exercise, so I provided a conceptual approach below.</p>
            <p><strong>1. Hypotheses</strong></p>
            <p>The goal is to test whether the population mean income for men exceeds that of women. This involves a
              one-tailed, two-sample t-test.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Null Hypothesis (𝐾<sub>0</sub>):</strong> The mean income for men (μ<sub>M</sub>) is less
                than or equal to the mean income for women (μ<sub>F</sub>)
              </li>
              <li><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (𝐾<sub>a</sub>):</strong> The mean income for men (μ<sub>M</sub>) is
                greater than the mean income for women (μ<sub>F</sub>)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>2. Test Statistic</strong></p>
            <p>The test statistic for a two-sample t-test is calculated as:</p>
            <pre>
            t = (X̄<sub>M</sub> - X̄<sub>F</sub>) / sqrt((s<sup>2</sup><sub>M</sub> / n<sub>M</sub>) + (s<sup>2</sup><sub>F</sub> / n<sub>F</sub>))
            </pre>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>X̄<sub>M</sub>, X̄<sub>F</sub>:</strong> Mean income of males and females, respectively.</li>
              <li><strong>s<sup>2</sup><sub>M</sub>, s<sup>2</sup><sub>F</sub>:</strong> Variances of male and female
                income samples.
              </li>
              <li><strong>n<sub>M</sub>, n<sub>F</sub>:</strong> Sample sizes of males and females, respectively.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>3. Assumptions for Validity</strong></p>
            <p>The validity of the test relies on these assumptions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Independence:</strong> Observations within and between the groups are independent.</li>
              <li><strong>Normality:</strong> The income data for both groups is approximately normally distributed.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Homogeneity of Variance:</strong> The variance of income is similar for men and women.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>4. Steps for Validation</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Independence:</strong> Check the design of the data collection to ensure no dependency exists
                between observations.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Normality:</strong> Use graphical methods or statistical tests to assess the distribution of
                income.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Homogeneity of Variance:</strong> Use Levene's test or Bartlett's test to verify whether
                variances are equal. If there are not, use a t-test assuming unequal variances.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>5. Interpretation</strong></p>
            <p>If the calculated p-value is less than the significance level, reject the null hypothesis and conclude
              that the population mean income for men is significantly higher than that for women. Otherwise, fail
              to reject the null hypothesis.</p>

            <p><strong>6. Reporting Findings</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Report the test statistic (t) and p-value.</li>
              <li>Include confidence intervals for the difference in means.</li>
              <li>Discuss practical significance, if applicable.</li>
            </ul>

          <p><strong><u>Description</u></strong></p>
          <p>This unit was the seventh unit of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module. This unit focused
            on inferential statistics and hypothesis testing. The goals of this unit were to understand the principles
            of inferential statistics and their applications in data analysis, to identify and apply appropriate
            probability distributions for statistical inference and to learn how to conduct hypothesis testing to
            evaluate assumptions and compare population values effectively.</p>
          <p>In this unit, there was a collaborative discussion on the legal, social and ethical concerns Abi must
            consider in the case study, the hypothesis testing worksheet, the summary measures worksheet and a lecture
            cast on summary measures and Inference. We were also required to read chapter 4, 9 &amp; 10 from the book on
            Basic Business Statistics (Berenson et al., 2019) and the article on inferential statistics (Purdue
            University, 2023) and had to hand in the literature review assignment.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Feelings</u></strong></p>
          <p>I felt overwhelmed this week due to the number of tasks to complete alongside the literature review
            assignment. Missing the lecture added to my stress, as I only realised after the assignment submission that my references
            needed to be in alphabetical order, which was not a requirement in previous modules or stated in the
            university's guidelines. This oversight made me feel frustrated and anxious about my grade. Additionally, I
            found the grammatical errors in the lecture cast distracting, which affected my focus. Despite these
            challenges, I appreciated the structure of the worksheets, as they helped clarify concepts, I initially
            found confusing.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Evaluation</u></strong></p>
          <p>The unit provided valuable insights into inferential statistics, particularly through the hands-on
            worksheets, which reinforced my understanding of hypothesis testing. The collaborative discussion on legal,
            social, and ethical concerns broadened my perspective on real-world applications of research. However,
            missing the lecture negatively impacted my ability to adhere to assignment requirements. The lack of clarity
            in referencing expectations and the errors in the lecture cast content reduced the overall quality of the
            learning experience.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Analysis</u></strong></p>
          <p>The challenges I faced this week highlighted the importance of attending lectures and reviewing recordings
            promptly to avoid missing critical information. The university's inconsistency in referencing requirements
            created confusion, demonstrating a need for clearer communication and standardised guidelines. Despite these
            setbacks, the unit's emphasis on statistical inference was beneficial, as it provided a strong foundation
            for future research tasks. The worksheets were particularly effective in translating theoretical concepts
            into practical skills, such as identifying probability distributions and performing hypothesis tests.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
          <p>Although I gained significant knowledge from this unit, missing the lecture and encountering
            inconsistencies in referencing guidelines hindered my performance. Improved time management and better
            communication from the university could have alleviated these issues. The practical components of the unit,
            such as the worksheets and discussions, were highly valuable and enhanced my understanding of inferential
            statistics.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Action plan</u></strong></p>
          <p>To improve my performance in the module going forward, I will ensure I attend all lectures or watch
            recordings promptly to stay updated on assignment expectations and key concepts, use formative feedback from
            discussions and worksheets to enhance my understanding and improve future assignments and allocate specific
            time slots for completing readings and worksheets to ensure tasks are not rushed, even during busy
            weeks.</p>

          <h5>How the reflection relates to the module objectives</h5>
          <p>The Unit 7 Reflection plays a significant role in reinforcing the module objectives by allowing students to
            critically assess their understanding of inferential statistics, hypothesis testing, and their application
            in computing research. This reflective exercise encouraged me to evaluate my learning progress,
            identify challenges faced in applying statistical methods, and consider improvements in my approach to
            research methodology.</p>
          <p>One of the key module objectives is to appraise the principles of academic investigation and apply them to
            a research topic in the applicable computing field. Through the reflection, I analyzed how I
            applied hypothesis testing, probability distributions, and statistical inference in my research process.
            By reviewing my engagement with inferential statistics, I deepened my understanding of how these
            techniques support evidence-based decision-making in computing research&mdash;such as in machine learning
            model validation, cybersecurity risk assessment, and performance evaluation of computing systems.</p>
          <p>Additionally, this reflection supports the module objective of evaluating critically existing literature,
            research design, and methodology, including data analysis processes. The process of reflecting on
            inferential statistics and hypothesis testing required me to consider the strengths and weaknesses of
            different statistical approaches, assess their appropriateness for different research contexts, and
            recognise the potential for bias or misinterpretation in data analysis. This aligns with the broader goal of
            ensuring research validity and reliability in computing studies.</p>
          <p>The Unit 7 Reflection also contributes to the objective of appraising the professional, legal, social,
            cultural, and ethical issues that affect computing professionals. Statistical inference is widely used in
            computing, but misuse or misinterpretation of statistical data can lead to false claims, biased conclusions,
            and unethical decision-making. By reflecting on my learning, I was able to recognise the importance of
            transparency, reproducibility, and integrity in research, reinforcing the ethical responsibility of
            computing professionals to ensure accurate and responsible use of data.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the reflection aligns with the module objective of producing and critically evaluating a
            research proposal. A well-structured research proposal requires a clear justification of research methods,
            particularly in relation to data collection, statistical analysis, and hypothesis testing. By reflecting on
            the challenges and insights gained from hypothesis testing, I was able to refine my approach to
            selecting appropriate research methodologies, ensuring my future research proposals are methodologically
            sound and data-driven.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, the Unit 7 Reflection directly contributes to achieving the module&rsquo;s objectives by
            encouraging students to critically assess their understanding of statistical inference, evaluate research
            methodologies, reflect on ethical considerations in data analysis, and refine their approach to developing
            research proposals. Through this process of self-evaluation, I gained valuable insights into my
            strengths and areas for improvement, ultimately enhancing my ability to conduct rigorous and ethical
            computing research</p>
