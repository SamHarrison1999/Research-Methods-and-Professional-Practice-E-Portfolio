            <p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></p>
            <p>In the case study, Abi was responsible for analysing the nutritional values of a new cereal named Whizzz.
              Whilst reviewing the collected data, Abi encounters an ethical dilemma as whilst their finding suggests
              Whizzz is less nutritious than claimed and may even be harmful, there are statistical approaches; they
              could employ to highlight correlations that portray the product in a more favourable light. This scenario
              raises questions about the ethical use of data, the responsibilities of researchers and the potential
              consequences of their decisions. In this post, I aim to explore these issues from ethical, legal, social
              and professional perspectives while providing recommendations for Abi.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Ethical Considerations</u></strong></p>
            <p>Maintaining integrity in research is of the utmost importance as ethical standards demand honesty and
              transparency. Manipulating or selectively reporting data to support a specific outcome even if it is
              technically accurate, is unethical. Doing so could distort the truth, mislead stakeholders or undermine
              public trust in scientific research. This idea is reinforced by the British Psychological Society&rsquo;s
              Code of Human Research Ethics which states &ldquo;researchers are obligated to ensure their work does not
              mislead or harm&rdquo; (British Psychological Society, 2014).</p>
            <p>Abi must consider whether they have a moral obligation to present both the positive and negative aspects
              of their findings. Selectively using statistics to highlight one particular outcome may be perceived as
              &ldquo;cherry-picking&rdquo; which compromises the credibility of the data and leads to a distorted
              representation of reality (Benos et al., 2007). Ethical research requires a balanced presentation of
              results to ensure objectivity and transparency.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Legal and Professional Responsibility</u></strong></p>
            <p>There are plenty of legal and professional considerations that Abi must consider. For example, in the
              United Kingdom, misleading claims about products are subject to legal scrutiny due to the Unfair Trading
              Regulations (UK Government, 2008) which prohibits deceptive advertising practices that could harm
              consumers. As a result of this, if the manufacturer uses Abi&rsquo;s findings selectively to promote
              Whizzz as nutritious while disregarding evidence to the contrary, Abi may be found complicit in the eyes
              of the law.</p>
            <p>Abi must adhere to codes of conduct established within their field, which prioritise responsibility,
              accuracy, and the prevention of harm. Allowing the misuse of their analyses could damage Abi&rsquo;s
              reputation, the institution's creditability, and the broader scientific community. Therefore, Abi has a
              responsibility to ensure their work is used ethically and responsibly by the manufacturer.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Social and Professional Impact</u></strong></p>
            <p>Abi&rsquo;s decisions carry significant social implications concerning public health and trust in
              research. Misrepresenting the nutritional value of Whizzz could mislead consumers into making dietary
              choices that harm their health and has the potential to damage public confidence in the scientific process
              and negatively impact the credibility of researchers and institutions. Research has shown that the spread
              of biased or misleading research findings erodes trust in scientific research, hindering its ability to
              effectively serve society (Loannidis, 2005).</p>
            <p>Abi is accountable for the outcomes of their work even if they are not directly responsible for how the
              manufacturer uses their findings, they have a duty to advocate for their ethical application of their
              results. By adopting a proactive approach, Abi can help to mitigate the risks associated with the misuse
              of
              their analyses.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Recommendations</u></strong></p>
            <p>To tackle the social, ethical and legal challenges present in the case study Abi should take several
              steps. Firstly, they must present both the positive and negative findings from their analyses to ensure
              transparency, objectivity and honesty. Secondly, Abi should communicate to the manufacturer the potential
              ethical and legal risks associated with selective reporting. Thirdly, Abi should consider publishing their
              findings in a peer-reviewed journal to ensure accountability and transparency. Lastly, Abi should include
              any disclaimers or contractual agreements to help prevent the misuse of their analyses.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
            <p>Abi&rsquo;s situation highlights the connection between ethical responsibility, legal accountability, and
              societal impact in research. By maintaining transparency, advocating for the ethical use of data, and
              considering the wider implications of their actions, Abi can fulfil their professional obligations while
              protecting public trust and safety. Ultimately, a commitment to ethical principles will enhance Abi's
              integrity as a researcher and contribute to the credibility and value of scientific inquiry.</p>

            <h5>Responses from peers</h5>
            <h6>Response 1</h6>
            <p>Hello Samuel,</p>
            <p>Including disclaimers or contractual agreements is a strong approach to preventing the misuse of Abi's
              analyses. While disclaimers provide clarity on the intended scope and limitations of the work, contractual
              agreements take ethical safeguards further by legally binding all parties to specific responsibilities and
              standards.</p>
            <p>The idea of a contractual agreement is particularly compelling, as it helps establish clear obligations,
              manage relationships, and promote ethical accountability between involved parties (Beck &amp; Purcell,
              2023). Such agreements align with the principles of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct and
              the BCS Code of Conduct, which emphasise the importance of avoiding harm and acting in the public
              interest.</p>
            <p>For Abi, including ethical clauses in a contract could explicitly define acceptable uses of the analyses
              and specify consequences for misuse. This approach not only deters potential harm but also reflects a
              proactive commitment to transparency and trust. By integrating these measures, Abi would ensure their work
              aligns with professional and societal values, strengthening accountability and reinforcing ethical
              standards in their practice.</p>

            <h6>Response 2</h6>
            <p>Hello Samuel,<br><br> Thank you for your insightful comments and analysis. I appreciate how you&rsquo;ve
              categorised the consequences of Abi&rsquo;s actions into ethical, legal, social, and professional
              dimensions, making it easier to understand the situation's complexity. Additionally, your focus on
              proactive solutions and recommendations demonstrates a clear commitment to addressing Abi's ethical
              challenges.<br> Your suggestion to include disclaimers and contractual agreements is particularly
              noteworthy. Furthermore, publishing in a peer-reviewed journal is another approach that piqued my
              interest. These strategies could indeed serve as safeguards to prevent misuse of Abi&rsquo;s analysis.
              However, I would like to expand on this idea.<br><br> For instance, a disclaimer could help protect
              against reputation harm, clarifying that the findings should not be used selectively. A contractual
              agreement gives Abi more control over the use of their findings by the manufacturer, ensuring that the
              results are used responsibly and ethically.<br><br> On the other hand, publishing research in an
              open-access format can enhance accessibility, aligning with the European Commission's Horizon 2020 Open
              Access policy. Making the findings openly available provides transparency. However, this also means that
              Abi would need to be cautious about how their work is interpreted or misused by others&nbsp;(European
              Commission, N.D.).</p>
            <p>These approaches, when combined, can provide both transparency and protection for Abi&rsquo;s work,
              ensuring that their ethical and legal responsibilities are upheld.<br><br>Reference:<br><br>European

            <h5>Example 7.2</h5>
            <p>Example 7.2 asked us to use a spreadsheet file that wasn't provided, so I was unable to complete the
              exercise, so I provided a conceptual approach below.</p>
            <p><strong>1. Hypotheses</strong></p>
            <p>The goal is to test whether the population mean income for men exceeds that of women. This involves a
              one-tailed, two-sample t-test.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Null Hypothesis (𝐾<sub>0</sub>):</strong> The mean income for men (μ<sub>M</sub>) is less
                than or equal to the mean income for women (μ<sub>F</sub>)
              </li>
              <li><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (𝐾<sub>a</sub>):</strong> The mean income for men (μ<sub>M</sub>) is
                greater than the mean income for women (μ<sub>F</sub>)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>2. Test Statistic</strong></p>
            <p>The test statistic for a two-sample t-test is calculated as:</p>
            <pre>
            t = (X̄<sub>M</sub> - X̄<sub>F</sub>) / sqrt((s<sup>2</sup><sub>M</sub> / n<sub>M</sub>) + (s<sup>2</sup><sub>F</sub> / n<sub>F</sub>))
            </pre>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>X̄<sub>M</sub>, X̄<sub>F</sub>:</strong> Mean income of males and females, respectively.</li>
              <li><strong>s<sup>2</sup><sub>M</sub>, s<sup>2</sup><sub>F</sub>:</strong> Variances of male and female
                income samples.
              </li>
              <li><strong>n<sub>M</sub>, n<sub>F</sub>:</strong> Sample sizes of males and females, respectively.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>3. Assumptions for Validity</strong></p>
            <p>The validity of the test relies on these assumptions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Independence:</strong> Observations within and between the groups are independent.</li>
              <li><strong>Normality:</strong> The income data for both groups is approximately normally distributed.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Homogeneity of Variance:</strong> The variance of income is similar for men and women.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>4. Steps for Validation</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Independence:</strong> Check the design of the data collection to ensure no dependency exists
                between observations.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Normality:</strong> Use graphical methods or statistical tests to assess the distribution of
                income.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Homogeneity of Variance:</strong> Use Levene's test or Bartlett's test to verify whether
                variances are equal. If there are not, use a t-test assuming unequal variances.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>5. Interpretation</strong></p>
            <p>If the calculated p-value is less than the significance level, reject the null hypothesis and conclude
              that the population mean income for men is significantly higher than that for women. Otherwise, fail
              to reject the null hypothesis.</p>

            <p><strong>6. Reporting Findings</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Report the test statistic (t) and p-value.</li>
              <li>Include confidence intervals for the difference in means.</li>
              <li>Discuss practical significance, if applicable.</li>
            </ul>

          <!-- Reflection Section -->
          <h5 id="reflection">Reflection</h5>
          <p><strong><u>Description</u></strong></p>
          <p>This unit was the seventh unit of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module. This unit focused
            on inferential statistics and hypothesis testing. The goals of this unit were to understand the principles
            of inferential statistics and their applications in data analysis, to identify and apply appropriate
            probability distributions for statistical inference and to learn how to conduct hypothesis testing to
            evaluate assumptions and compare population values effectively.</p>
          <p>In this unit, there was a collaborative discussion on the legal, social and ethical concerns Abi must
            consider in the case study, the hypothesis testing worksheet, the summary measures worksheet and a lecture
            cast on summary measures and Inference. We were also required to read chapter 4, 9 &amp; 10 from the book on
            Basic Business Statistics (Berenson et al., 2019) and the article on inferential statistics (Purdue
            University, 2023) and had to hand in the literature review assignment.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Feelings</u></strong></p>
          <p>I felt overwhelmed this week due to the number of tasks to complete alongside the literature review
            assignment. Missing the lecture added to my stress, as I only realised after submission that my references
            needed to be in alphabetical order, which was not a requirement in previous modules or stated in the
            university's guidelines. This oversight made me feel frustrated and anxious about my grade. Additionally, I
            found the grammatical errors in the lecture cast distracting, which affected my focus. Despite these
            challenges, I appreciated the structure of the worksheets, as they helped clarify concepts, I initially
            found confusing.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Evaluation</u></strong></p>
          <p>The unit provided valuable insights into inferential statistics, particularly through the hands-on
            worksheets, which reinforced my understanding of hypothesis testing. The collaborative discussion on legal,
            social, and ethical concerns broadened my perspective on real-world applications of research. However,
            missing the lecture negatively impacted my ability to adhere to assignment requirements. The lack of clarity
            in referencing expectations and the errors in the lecture cast content reduced the overall quality of the
            learning experience.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Analysis</u></strong></p>
          <p>The challenges I faced this week highlighted the importance of attending lectures and reviewing recordings
            promptly to avoid missing critical information. The university's inconsistency in referencing requirements
            created confusion, demonstrating a need for clearer communication and standardised guidelines. Despite these
            setbacks, the unit's emphasis on statistical inference was beneficial, as it provided a strong foundation
            for future research tasks. The worksheets were particularly effective in translating theoretical concepts
            into practical skills, such as identifying probability distributions and performing hypothesis tests.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
          <p>Although I gained significant knowledge from this unit, missing the lecture and encountering
            inconsistencies in referencing guidelines hindered my performance. Improved time management and better
            communication from the university could have alleviated these issues. The practical components of the unit,
            such as the worksheets and discussions, were highly valuable and enhanced my understanding of inferential
            statistics.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Action plan</u></strong></p>
          <p>To improve my performance in the module going forward, I will ensure I attend all lectures or watch
            recordings promptly to stay updated on assignment expectations and key concepts, use formative feedback from
            discussions and worksheets to enhance my understanding and improve future assignments and allocate specific
            time slots for completing readings and worksheets to ensure tasks are not rushed, even during busy
            weeks.</p>
