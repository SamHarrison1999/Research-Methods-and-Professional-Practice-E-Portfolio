            <h5 id="reflectiveActivity">Reflective Activity 1 – Ethics in Computing in the Age of Generative AI</h5>
            <p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></p>
            <p>I&rsquo;m going to start with some key definitions before reflecting on the ethical considerations
              relevant to AI citing the paper on worldwide AI Ethics (Correa et al., 2023), the article on Ethics in AI
              (Deckard, 2023) and my own independent research on AI Ethics. Then I&rsquo;ll discuss how different
              countries across the world mitigate the legal, social and ethical concerns relevant to Generative AI.</p>
            <p><strong><u>What is meant by ethics?</u></strong></p>
            <p>The Oxford English dictionary defines ethics as a set of moral principles that govern a person's
              behaviour
              or the conduct of an activity (Oxford English Dictionary, 2014).</p>
            <p><strong><u>What is meant by AI? </u></strong></p>
            <p>IBM defines Artificial intelligence (AI) as the technology that enables computers and machines to
              simulate
              human learning, comprehension, problem-solving, decision-making, creativity and autonomy (IBM, 2024).</p>
            <p><strong><u>What is meant by Generative AI?</u></strong></p>
            <p>IBM defines Generative AI as deep-learning models that can generate high-quality text, images, and other
              content based on the data they were trained on (IBM, 2023).</p>
            <p><strong><u>Worldwide AI ethics: A review of 200 guidelines and recommendations for AI
              governance</u></strong></p>
            <p>In the paper Worldwide AI ethics: A review of 200 guidelines and recommendations for AI governance
              (Correa et al., 2023) Nicholas Correa, Camila Galvao, James Santos and Carolina Carvalho performed an
              n-gram analysis on 200 documents from 37 different countries in five different languages in an attempt to
              form a global consensus on the guidelines and recommendations for AI governance. They critiqued the
              research done on AI ethics to date, citing studies by Anna Jobin, Thilo Hagendorff and Jessica Fjeld and
              proposed not to use popularity-based filtering of documents to gain a global view of AI ethics.</p>
            <p>They categorised each of the 200 documents based on the content of the document, the type of regulation,
              the normative strength of the regulation and the impact scope. Then they categorised the ethical
              principles for AI into the following seventeen categories; accountability/liability,
              beneficence/non-maleficence, children and adolescent rights, dignity/human rights,
              diversity/inclusion/pluralism/accessibility, freedom/autonomy/democratic values/technological sovereignty,
              human formation/education, human-centeredness/alignment, intellectual property,
              justice/equity/non-discrimination, labour rights, cooperation/fair competition/open source, privacy,
              reliability/safety/security/trustworthiness, sustainability, transparency/explainability/auditability and
              truthfulness.</p>
            <p>There were some severe limitations to their study, however, which put the validity of their results into
              question as the study only focused on documents written in 5 different languages, it excluded academic
              papers, it excluded any historical data. Additionally, South American, African and Oceania countries were 
              significantly underrepresented and the data was not diverse enough to provide significant value as over half
              of the data came from governmental institutions and private organisations, and the majority of data was normative
              and focused on recommendations. Due to the majority of data being from Europe and America and the
              exclusion criteria it's my opinion that the data wasn&rsquo;t complete enough to represent a worldwide
              view on AI ethics.</p>
            <p><strong><u>What are Ethics in AI</u></strong></p>
            <p>The article written by Richard Deckard on behalf of the British Computer Society (BCS) outlines what it
              means to become an AI ethicist and the steps you must take (Deckard, 2023).</p>
            <p>Deckard defined AI ethics as the principles and values that guide the development and deployment of AI
              technologies, ensuring that they&rsquo;re designed and used in a way that is fair, transparent, and
              accountable.</p>
            <p>Deckard proposed there are 7 key steps to becoming an AI ethicist; first you must build a strong
              foundation is ethics and technology, then you must stay informed on AI developments, then you must
              understand the context of AI ethics, then you must develop strong communication skills, then you must
              collaborate with other disciplines, then you must participate in public policy discussions, then you must
              develop practical solutions.</p>
            <p>While I agree with the points raised by Deckard, I view the BCS article on Ethics in AI only as a good
              starting point for understanding ethics in AI as it looks at the ethical considerations only at a high
              level.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Ethical challenges and Solutions of Generative AI: An Interdisciplinary
              Perspective</u></strong></p>
            <p>The paper on the ethical challenges of Generative AI by Mousa Al-Kfairy, Dheya Mustafa, Nir Kshetri,
              Mazen Insiew and Omar Alfandi theorised the ethical challenges of AI are related to privacy, data
              protection, copyright infringement, misinformation, biases and societal inequalities, deepfakes, synthetic
              media, consent, human rights, transparency, fairness, openness, authenticity, accountability, identity
              theft, environmental impact, over reliance on technology, discrimination, labour displacement, monopolies,
              responsible usage and integrity.</p>
            <p>One of the many examples they used was about academic integrity when a student uses AI to write an
              assignment. Stating that it is unfair to the other students who actually did the work and that their
              dependence on AI could result in a lower level of knowledge.</p>
            <p>The areas they focused on were authorship and academic integrity, regulatory and legal issues, privacy,
              trust and biases, misinformation and deepfakes, educational ethics, transparency and accountability,
              authenticity and attribution and social and economic impact.</p>
            <p><strong><u>IBM Principles for Trust and Transparency </u></strong></p>
            <p>IBM&rsquo;s three principles for trust and transparency are the purpose of AI is to augment human
              intelligence, data and insights belong to their creator and new technology must be transparent and
              explainable (IBM, 2018).</p>
            <p><strong><u>The global landscape of AI ethics guidelines</u></strong></p>
            <p>Anna Jobin, Marcello Ienca and Effy Vayena theorised the majority of the ethical principles relevant to
              AI are related to transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility and privacy. They
              also cited beneficence, freedom and autonomy, trust, dignity, sustainability and solidarity as the other
              ethical principles that should be considered (Jobin et al., 2019).</p>
            <p><strong><u>SAP&rsquo;s Global AI Ethics Guiding Principles and Governance Bodies</u></strong></p>
            <p>SAP's ten ethical principles are; proportionality and do not harm, safety and security, fairness and
              non-discrimination, sustainability, right to privacy and data protection, human oversight and
              determination, transparency and explainability, responsibility and accountability, awareness and literacy
              and multi-stakeholder and adoptive governance (SAP 2024).</p>
            <p><strong><u>Mitigating the legal, social and ethical issues of Generative AI</u></strong></p>
            <p>The social and ethical concerns of AI are mainly related to privacy breaches, algorithmic discrimination,
              algorithmic opacity, security issues, reliability issues, transparency issues, increased surveillance,
              environmental cost, legal accountability, sentient AI, misaligned AI, super-intelligent AI, AI-related
              existential risks, AI interfering in democratic processes, autonomous weapons, environmental
              sustainability, labour displacement and the principle of truthfulness. Whereas the legal concerns centre
              around data protection, privacy, intellectual property and copyright laws.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
            <p>Based on the articles and my own independent research, I believe the major ethical concerns for AI are
              related to transparency, accountability, privacy, equality, security, and trust.</p>
            <p>Additionally, there are many steps that individuals, organisations and governments can take to
              mitigate the legal, social and ethical issues created Generative AI such as continuing their professional
              development and constantly upskilling to reduce the risk of labour displacement and by watermarking any
              content created by AI to avoid any copyright infringement.</p>

            <h6>How the Reflective Activity on Ethics in Computing in the Age of Generative AI relates to the module objectives</h6>
            <p>The Reflective Activity on the Ethics in Computing in the Age of Generative AI is closely aligned with
              the module goals, as it encouraged a critical examination of ethical, legal, and professional
              concerns in the field of artificial intelligence. This activity required engagement with contemporary issues related to
              Generative AI, such as bias, misinformation, accountability, and data privacy. By exploring these topics,
              I was able to develop a deeper understanding of the broader ethical responsibilities that
              computing professionals must uphold, particularly in accordance with established frameworks such as the
              ACM Code of Ethics and the BCS Code of Conduct. The activity reinforced the necessity of ethical computing
              practices, ensuring that students are equipped to assess the impact of AI technologies on individuals,
              businesses, and society.</p>
            <p>The activity also contributed to the understanding of academic investigation principles by requiring
              students to engage with research on AI ethics. By analysing scholarly articles, case studies, and ethical
              guidelines, I developed the ability to critically assess academic sources, evaluate different
              perspectives, and apply ethical reasoning to real-world computing issues. This process highlighted the
              importance of transparency, integrity, and responsible research practices, which are fundamental to
              conducting credible and ethically sound academic investigations. Furthermore, it emphasised the role of
              ethical considerations in shaping responsible technological development, ensuring that research and
              innovations align with societal values.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the activity supported the development of critical evaluation skills concerning existing
              literature, research design, and data analysis processes. By engaging with discussions on AI&rsquo;s
              ethical implications, I was encouraged to scrutinise methodologies used in AI research, assess
              potential biases, and consider the limitations of existing approaches. This practice reinforced the
              importance of critically evaluating sources, methodologies, and arguments when conducting research in
              computing, preparing me for the rest of my studies.</p>
            <p>Finally, the insights gained from this activity were directly relevant to the production and evaluation
              of my research proposal. Ethical considerations play a crucial role in research design, from ensuring data
              privacy and informed consent to mitigating biases and maintaining research integrity. This reflective
              activity helped me recognise the ethical challenges that may arise in AI-related research and
              provided a foundation for integrating ethical reasoning into my research proposal. By addressing these
              concerns proactively, I can design research that is not only methodologically sound but also
              ethically responsible, aligning with best practices in the computing field.</p>
            <p>Overall, this reflective activity was instrumental in enhancing my awareness of the ethical
              dimensions of computing and the role of professional responsibility in technological advancements. It
              provided me with a strong foundation for applying ethical principles to academic research and professional
              practice, ensuring that I was well-prepared to navigate the ethical complexities of AI and
              computing in my future careers.</p>

            <h5 id="collaborativeDiscussionInitialPost">Collaborative Discussion 1 - Initial Post</h5>
            <p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></p>
            <p>In this collaborative discussion, I will be highlighting the legal, ethical and social concerns from the
              malware case study from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM, 2018).</p>
            <p>The case study focuses on Rouge Services, a fictitious company that provided web hosting services to
              cyber criminals until they were forcibly taken offline by a cyber-attack.</p>
            <p><strong><u>BSC Code of Conduct Violations</u></strong></p>
            <p>The BCS Code of Conduct (BCS, 2022) is a set of key principles for ensuring the integrity of IT
              professionals. There are four key principles of the BSC code of conduct; the first one is related to
              public
              interest, the second one is related to professional competence and integrity, the third one is related to
              duty to authority, and the final one is related to duty to profession.</p>
            <p>Rouge Services violated the public interest principle as they showed no regard for the privacy or
              security of others when they refused to do anything to stop cyber criminals from hosting malware on their
              services. Their inaction could be interpreted as a human rights violation as the right to privacy is a
              fundamental human right in over 185 countries (European Data Protection Supervisor, 2024).</p>
            <p>Rouge Services violated the principle related to integrity as their inaction and lack of cooperation with
              governmental agencies caused harm to the victims of the cyber-attacks carried out by their users.</p>
            <p>Rouge Services violated the principle related to the duty to relevant authority as by failing to take any form of
              responsibility for the cyber-attacks after they were made aware of them. In most jurisdictions, Rouge
              Services would be considered complicit in their users&rsquo; crimes and could even be incarcerated.</p>
            <p><strong><u>ACM Code of Ethics Violations</u></strong></p>
            <p>The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (ACM, 2021) outlines a series of ethical principles,
              professional responsibilities and professional leadership principles that computing professionals must
              abide by.</p>
            <p>The general ethical principles are related to avoiding harm and the quality of life of all people
              (principles 1.1 and 1.2) were violated by Rouge Services as by allowing cybercriminals to host malicious
              software they facilitated the harm caused by their clients.</p>
            <p>The professional responsibilities related to the public good (principles 2.8 and 3.1) were violated by
              Rouge Services as they were aware their services were being used by cybercriminals for criminal activity
              and took no action, thereby failing to consider the public good.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
            <p>Whilst Rouge Services' actions weren&rsquo;t technically illegal in their jurisdiction it was most
              certainly unethical as they didn&rsquo;t consider the harm, they did to others by allowing their users to
              carry out cyber-attacks. Additionally, the lack of cooperation with governmental agencies and the steps
              said governmental agencies had to take to resolve the situation suggests a company that is only concerned
              with its profits.</p>

              1</h5>
            <p>Hi Samuel,</p>
            <p>Thank you for the clear and concise analysis of the Malware case study.</p>
            <p>Your post is both insightful and thought-provoking. You successfully identified and provided explanations
              of the ethics violations that were persistently carried out by the Rogue company. The conclusion you
              provided draws a clear line between the legal and the ethical issues which were ignored by the Rogue
              company.</p>
            <p>As you identified, this case highlights the Rogue company&rsquo;s refusal and unwillingness to take any
              action against unethical behaviour of their clients. The refusal to address this unethical behaviour
              suggests that the company ignored both the ACM (ACM, 2018) and BCS (BCS, 2022) principles because they
              were, potentially, not required to do so legally.</p>
            <p>One way to possibly expand and enhance your post could be aligning ACM Code of Ethics principles with BCS
              Code of Conduct principles regarding the specific violations.</p>

            <h5 id="collaborativeDiscussionInitialPostResponseTwo">Collaborative Discussion 1 - Initial Post Response
              2</h5>
            <p>Good afternoon,</p>
            <p>I enjoyed reading your insight into the operations of Rogue Services, and have they acted in regard to
              malware.</p>
            <p>I think your highlighting of potential human rights implications on the acts of IT professionals is
              important to discuss. We often think about the direct ethical impacts of our work in the sector, but the
              truth is that it can impact people in a much more profound way.</p>
            <p>I think it would have been beneficial to look at the ethics discussions that arose when the actor took
              aim at
              Rogue Services to take them down. While they did launch their own attacks on Rogue Services, the ethical
              implications of this are different due to the aims that the "good faith" actors did.</p>
            <p>Overall, though, very enjoyable.</p>
            <br>
            <h5 id="collaborativeDiscussionInitialPostResponseThree">Collaborative Discussion 1 - Initial Post Response
              3</h5>
            <p>Your response effectively highlights the ethical and legal complexities of the case. To consider this
              from another perspective, Rogue Services' behaviour can be likened to a landlord knowingly renting
              properties to individuals engaging in harmful activities. While the building manager may not explicitly
              break the
              law, their inaction enables harm and erodes trust in their profession. Similarly, Rogue exploited the
              absence of legal restrictions in their jurisdiction to justify unethical practices.</p>
            <p>Gotterbarn (2016) emphasises that codes of ethics, like the ACM&rsquo;s, provide aspirational goals that
              extend beyond legal requirements, offering moral guidance for professionals to act responsibly even in the
              absence of formal regulations. While the law may not have addressed Rogue&rsquo;s actions, the ACM Code
              fills this gap, urging computing professionals to prioritise societal well-being and avoid harm. This
              underscores how ethical codes serve as critical safeguards for public trust when the law falls short.</p>

            <h6>How the initial post for the first collaborative discussion relates to the module objectives</h6>
            <p>The initial post to the collaborative discussion in Unit 1 is a crucial component of the Research Methods
              and Professional Practice module, directly aligning with its core learning objectives. This activity
              required students to engage in a structured discussion on a relevant research topic, fostering critical
              thinking, academic inquiry, and professional communication skills. By participating in this discussion,
              students were able to explore and apply the principles of academic investigation, one of the module's
              primary objectives. The post required a well-supported argument, encouraging students to engage with
              academic sources, evaluate existing literature, and formulate reasoned perspectives on key research issues
              in the field of computing.</p>
            <p>One of the main objectives of the module is to appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural, and
              ethical issues that affect computing professionals. The collaborative discussion initial post encouraged
              students to critically reflect on these issues within a research context, considering ethical dilemmas,
              data privacy concerns, or the broader implications of computing technologies. By constructing a thoughtful
              response based on academic literature and ethical frameworks, students were able to demonstrate their
              understanding of professional and ethical responsibilities in computing research. This process reinforced
              the importance of integrity, transparency, and accountability in academic and professional
              environments.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the collaborative discussion activity required students to apply academic investigation
              principles, which is another key objective of the module. The initial post prompted students to engage in
              a structured analysis of a computing-related research issue, fostering skills in literature review,
              research evaluation, and evidence-based argumentation. By synthesising relevant sources and articulating a
              well-reasoned perspective, students demonstrated their ability to critically assess existing research and
              integrate scholarly perspectives into their discussion. This aligns with the module&rsquo;s emphasis on
              developing academic research competencies, which are essential for conducting independent investigations
              in computing fields.</p>
            <p>Another critical objective of the module is to evaluate critically existing literature, research design,
              and methodology for a chosen research topic. In preparing their initial post, students were required to
              engage with academic sources, analyse different research methodologies, and assess their validity in
              relation to the discussion topic. This process helped students develop skills in research critique and
              evaluation, which are essential for assessing the credibility and reliability of research studies. By
              identifying gaps or limitations in existing studies, students gained a deeper understanding of research
              methodologies, enabling them to apply these insights to their own research projects later in the
              module.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the initial post laid the groundwork for the development of effective research proposals,
              addressing the module&rsquo;s objective of producing and critically evaluating a research proposal for a
              chosen topic. By engaging with a specific research issue and critically analysing it, students developed
              the foundational skills necessary for structuring their own research investigations. The collaborative
              discussion provided an early opportunity to articulate research questions, explore methodologies, and
              engage in scholarly discourse, all of which are essential elements of formulating a strong research
              proposal.</p>
            <p>Beyond academic skills, the initial post to the collaborative discussion also contributed to students&rsquo;
              professional development, as it required them to engage in meaningful discussions, defend their
              viewpoints, and interact with peers in a constructive and scholarly manner. These skills are highly
              valuable in academic and industry settings, where professionals must be able to communicate complex ideas,
              evaluate differing perspectives, and engage in critical debates on emerging issues in computing
              research.</p>
            <p>The collaborative discussion and peer responses fostered engagement with ethical dilemmas in computing
              research. Topics discussed included research integrity. By engaging with different perspectives and
              providing peer feedback, the ability to critically evaluate and communicate ethical and professional
              issues in computing research was strengthened. These discussions mirrored real-world research ethics
              committees where ethical concerns are debated and addressed.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the initial post to the collaborative discussion in Unit 1 plays a fundamental role in
              achieving the objectives of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module. It helps students to
              critically engage with ethical, legal, and professional issues in computing, apply academic research
              principles, evaluate literature and research methodologies, and lay the groundwork for their own research
              proposals. Additionally, it fosters effective academic communication skills, which are essential for
              professional and scholarly success in the field of computing research.</p>

            <h6>How the artefact relates to the module objectives</h6>
            <p>The Reasoning Quiz on the Unit 1 page of the e-Portfolio relates to the module objectives by developing
              critical thinking and analytical skills, which are essential for academic research and professional
              practice in computing. The quiz challenges students to apply logical reasoning, assess arguments, and
              evaluate information objectively, which aligns with the module&rsquo;s focus on appraising the principles
              of academic investigation and applying them to research topics in computing. Effective reasoning is
              fundamental when formulating research questions, designing methodologies, and interpreting data, ensuring
              that conclusions are based on sound logic rather than assumptions or biases.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the quiz supports the objective of evaluating critically existing literature, research
              design, and data analysis processes by reinforcing the ability to distinguish between strong and weak
              arguments. In research, assessing the credibility of sources, identifying logical fallacies, and
              constructing well-supported arguments are crucial for conducting thorough literature reviews and
              justifying research methodologies. By completing the quiz, students practice skills that will help them
              critique research studies, analyse findings, and present evidence-based conclusions.</p>
            <p>The ethical and professional dimensions of reasoning also connect the quiz to the module objective of
              appraising professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical issues affecting computing professionals. In
              computing and research, ethical reasoning plays a key role in decision-making, whether in data privacy,
              responsible AI development, or cybersecurity policies. The ability to apply structured reasoning helps
              professionals navigate complex ethical dilemmas and make informed, responsible choices in their work.</p>
            <p>Finally, the Reasoning Quiz contributes to the development and evaluation of a research proposal by
              encouraging students to think systematically and justify their choices in research design. The ability to
              construct coherent, logical arguments is essential when defending a research proposal, selecting
              appropriate methodologies, and interpreting results. By engaging with the quiz, students strengthen the
              foundational reasoning skills needed to articulate and defend their research work effectively.</p>
            <p>Overall, the Reasoning Quiz enhances students' critical thinking, supports the evaluation of research
              literature and methodologies, fosters ethical awareness in computing, and strengthens logical reasoning
              skills necessary for developing a well-structured research proposal.</p>

          <!-- Reflection Section -->
          <h5 id="reflection">Reflection</h5>
          <p><strong><u>Description</u></strong></p>
          <p>This unit was the introductory unit of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module. The goals of
            this unit were to be able to answer the following six questions; What is the purpose of research? What are
            the
            differences between deductive and inductive reasoning? What is the scientific method? What are research
            ethics? What are AI ethics? What topic are you going to choose for the literature review?</p>
          <p>For this unit of the module, we were required to read chapter 2 in the book &lsquo;Projects in Computing
            and Information Systems: A Student's Guide&rsquo; (Dawson, 2015), the AI Robotics Ethics Society&rsquo;s
            article on Worldwide AI Ethics (Correa et al., 2023), the article by Megan Finn and Katie Shilton critiquing
            the Menlo report (Finn &amp; Shilton, 2023), the SSRN electronic journal article on Principled Artificial
            Intelligence (Fjeld et al., 2020), the article from the British Computer Society on AI Ethics (Deckard,
            2023), the Code of Conduct for BCS Members (BCS, 2021), the blog post by Daniel Miessler on the differences
            between deductive and inductive reasoning (Miessler, 2018), the case studies on ethics from ACM (ACM, 2018)
            and the blog post by Dan Fleetwood on what research actually is (Question Pro, 2021).</p>
          <p>There were three formative activities for this unit. The first formative activity was a 1000-word
            reflective activity on how the different countries all over the world mitigate the social, legal and ethical
            issues related to Generative AI. The second formative activity was a collaborative discussion on the codes
            of ethics from ACM (ACM 2018) and BCS (BCS, 2021). We had to write an initial 200-word post on the relevant
            legal and social issues for one of the case studies from ACM (ACM, 2018). The third formative activity was a
            multiple-choice quiz on examples of inductive and deductive reasoning.</p>
          <p>There was a seminar for this unit of the module where Dr Outram introduced us to the module and went
            through the work, we would be expected to complete by the end of unit two.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Feelings</u></strong></p>
          <p>I was confused as to why the recording of the first lecture was placed in the collaborative discussion
            section instead of the module announcements section, as has been the case with all my previous modules.
            Normally this wouldn't be much of an issue as I have attended the majority of the lectures to this point in
            my studies, however, I missed the lecture for this unit as my phone didn&rsquo;t go off so I had to watch
            the recording of the lecture. Due to it not being where I expected, it took me a couple of days to see
            it.</p>
          <p>I didn't receive the lecture slides in advance of this lecture as stated in my reasonable adjustment plan.
            While this is understandable to an extent as the lecture took place one day after I was enrolled on the
            course, I hope this won&rsquo;t be a regular occurrence as has been the case with most modules as receiving
            the lecture slides early allows me to attend lectures being more prepared. I did receive an email from the
            Dr Outram notifying me that she is aware of my reasonable adjustment plan which is something I had never
            received before which seems to suggest my reasonable adjustment plan will be followed in this module which
            would be a refreshing change of pace since most lectures tend to just ignore it.</p>
          <p>While the introductory lecture was certainly a lot more detailed than previous modules, it did raise a
            couple of potential concerns for me, firstly, it seemed like Dr Outram was just reading off the slides and
            the
            slides were very wordy whilst this is not a major issue I would have expected Dr Outram to add some of her
            own insights as I fear if this continues, the attendance in the lectures will continue to fall as they may
            view them as pointless if the lecturer is just going to read off the slides as they can do that in their own
            time. Additionally, there were some minor grammatical errors on one of the slides again whilst this may not
            be a big issue it could suggest the course may have been rushed when put together. Another key takeaway from
            the lecture was the Dr Outram is a relatively slow talker which may take some getting used to.</p>
          <p>When I was reading through the learning platform, I noticed some more issues where the images on the
            learning platform pointed to a broken link and the year on some of the references wasn't correct. This is
            not something I would have expected from postgraduate studies as I would have expected the learning platform
            would have been regularly reviewed to prevent this issue. I am not sure whether this would have been done by
            IT, Dr Outram or a research assistant, but it is a huge oversight not to review the course content before
            students enrol in the module. I noticed a lot of mistakes in a previous module where the learning platform
            was out of date or contained duplicate entries, and it caused a great deal of confusion to both me and the
            other students, so I hope this does not happen again in this module.</p>
          <p>I was rather disappointed by the fact the questions from the reasoning quiz were copied verbatim off the
            internet as this could be a rather worrying sign of little effort on the lecture&rsquo;s behalf. I
            experienced this a lot during my undergraduate degree where it seemed like the lecturers didn&rsquo;t want
            to teach as they were primarily researchers and during lectures would just read off the slides. I would hope
            this isn&rsquo;t the case for a postgraduate degree.</p>
          <p>I felt as if the amount of work we were expected to do in this module was excessive as there was a
            significant amount of required reading in addition to the 1000-word reflective activity, the collaborative
            discussion and the multiple-choice quiz. This seems like a lot to do in a week for part-time students who
            typically have to balance their studies with other commitments.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Evaluation</u></strong></p>
          <p>The aspects of the unit that I feel went well were; all module goals were achieved, my ability to read
            and understand technical documents improved as a result of the significant amount of required reading and
            research I had to do in this unit of the module.</p>
          <p>I found the introductory lecture to be very informative, which is more than I could say for previous
            modules
            where the introductory lecture would typically be around 30 minutes. Due to the length of this lecture, Dr
            Outram was able to go into a lot more detail.</p>
          <p>The main area where I could have improved during this unit of the module was with my time management as
            during the first week of the module, I was still working on the portfolio assignment from the previous
            module so didn&rsquo;t have as much time to work on the formative activities this week as I would have
            liked,
            and as I missed the first lecture, I had to spend time re-watching the lecture that could have been spent
            working on the formative actives.</p>
          <p>The only other negatives I really had for this unit of the module were I would have liked to have received
            the lecture slides early even if it was only a day early as it would have allowed me to be more prepared for
            the module, and the reading required for this unit of the module felt tedious after a while due to the sheer
            amount of reading I did during this unit of the module.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Analysis</u></strong></p>
          <p>As someone who would struggle to determine social and ethical considerations due to my mental deficiencies,
            this unit provided me with an opportunity for significant personal growth, as by understanding relevant
            legal, ethical and social issues; I can make better decisions.</p>
          <p>As I am planning on applying for PHD&rsquo;s I believe this unit will be extremely beneficial as for part
            of the application process you have to write research proposals. Additionally, I believe this unit will
            prepare me for the dissertation as it will require a significant amount of research.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
          <p>Over the course of the unit, I learnt a lot about research, ethics, the scientific method and the different
            types of reasoning as I had never previously done any modules on research, so there was a lot of stuff to
            learn. As I am planning on doing a PHD and am actively thinking about working in research, knowing as much
            about research and ethics as possible is key.</p>
          <p>For my choice of topic for the literature review, I was unable to choose between the machine learning tools
            or techniques used in predicting sports results and the AI-based assistive technology for the disabled as
            both these topics are of particular interest to me as I watch a lot of sports, and I am disabled. My plan is
            to research both topics before deciding which one to do the literature review on.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Action plan</u></strong></p>
          <p>If I was to redo this unit of the module, I would have made sure not to miss the lecture and I would have
            managed my time better in the previous module and planned for being ill, so I wouldn't need to manage the
            workload of two modules for the first week as due to this I fell behind in this module.</p>

          <h5>How the artefact relates to the module objectives</h5>
          <p>The Unit 1 Reflection is directly related to the module goals, as it required critical engagement with
            the foundational concepts of research methods and professional practice in computing. This reflection
            encouraged students to consider the importance of professional, legal, social, cultural, and ethical issues
            in computing, particularly in relation to responsible research practices. By reflecting on the key themes
            introduced in Unit 1, students were able to recognise how ethical considerations, data protection
            regulations, and research integrity play a crucial role in the computing profession. This aligns with the
            module goal of appraising the impact of these factors on computing professionals and ensuring ethical
            compliance in research.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the reflection supported the appraisal of academic investigation principles by prompting
            students to consider the significance of research methods, literature reviews, and data collection
            strategies. Engaging with these concepts allowed students to develop an early understanding of how research
            is structured and the importance of a systematic approach to academic inquiry. By reflecting on their
            initial perspectives on research methodologies and their relevance to computing, students gained insight
            into the importance of rigour, validity, and reliability in academic work, which are essential principles of
            scholarly investigation.</p>
          <p>The Unit 1 Reflection also contributed to the critical evaluation of existing literature, research design,
            and methodology, as it encouraged students to assess their own research capabilities and identify areas for
            improvement. Through self-reflection, students were able to recognise gaps in their understanding of
            research processes and begin developing strategies to enhance their skills in evaluating sources,
            synthesising information, and applying theoretical frameworks. This self-assessment process is critical for
            fostering analytical thinking and improving research competency.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the reflection laid the groundwork for the development of a research proposal, as it allowed
            students to identify their research interests, explore potential topics, and consider how to structure their
            investigations. By reflecting on their learning experiences, students were able to establish a clearer
            direction for their research journey, which would later inform their topic selection, literature review, and
            methodology choices. This aligns with the module goal of producing and critically evaluating a research
            proposal, as it encouraged students to consider how to formulate research questions, justify methodological
            approaches, and expect challenges in their research.</p>
          <p>Overall, the Unit 1 Reflection was an essential part of the module, as it helped students bridge
            theoretical concepts with practical applications in research. It reinforced the importance of ethical
            research practices, academic integrity, and methodological rigour while encouraging students to think
            critically about their professional development and research capabilities.</p>
